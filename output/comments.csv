paltsNeM6Y0,Ugy-USyReFKSNzn-UzZ4AaABAg,,@markbooth3066,"In my experience, soap and water is *much* better than IPA. Evaporating IPA can leave a residue on a build plate that can actually make adhesion worse.

Even if I have something on my build plate that needs IPA to help remove it, I always wash it with soap and water afterwards. This fully removes both residual IPA and any deposits that soap is better at removing than IPA.

Also, I would highly recommend drying washed plates using lint free wipes, rather than a towel or paper towel. Cotton towels can shed cotton fibres onto the build plate, while paper towels can shed paper fibres. Fresh lint free cloths don't leave fibres of any kind behind, and prepare the print surface in a way that results in maximum first layer adhesion.

It can create a say a pot handle with a fancy inlay  from a raw stock, but you can't make a fancy inlay on a pot handle you already have. The machine is structure so it supposed to be ""automatic"" . but coming from a manual CNC with a manual z probe and manually changing end mills, the work flow doesn't make sense.

also if the RPM is slow this can also break the bit
and in the groves of the bit if you see material stuck like it is melted this could be that the bit is not sharp and it is time to replace it or ""feed rate"" (cutting movement sideways) is too fast or RPM is slow for that material or both

note: just bumping up the RPM can also break the bit if the feed is fast so it is better to slow down the feed rate first, this way you are not stressing the bit !
(it is better to not mess with the RPM that much, it is safer to change the feed rate and always start/test with slow feed)
with acrylic and plastic if the waste is stuck on the tool path after it is cut, then the bit has lose the sharpness but you can still use them for other stuff like soft MDF/wood (you don't have to do this with V-bits, only for flat end mill bits)  
also keep bit's used for wood/MDF separated if you can (bit's need to be sharp to cut acrylic but not that sharp for wood but cutting wood will lower the sharpness even in a new bit but for a CNC this size i don't think you have to worry about it) 

one last thing careful when you remove the rubber cover on the bit (the condom lol) you will cut yourself and you will bleed like the cut is about 6 times big, i don't know why but this has happen many times even when i know it, maybe get a tweezer !",1,2025-12-21T17:22:33Z

Don't 3D Print anything that is to take shear or torsional loading. It will snap like a cheap cast G-Clamp body.

CNC Milling and Jig Boring have the advantage they can finish a forged component, such as a motor engine crankshaft.
Model aircraft cranks and con-rods are from drawn alloy, which has been given a structure to withstand the stresses of operation.
This machine would be V useful for model aircraft engine crankcases, machined from a forged billet of aluminium alloy.

Metal printing is plenty strong, yet the machines and processes are quite expensive. Unless you have a use case that requires it, you're probably better off with CNC.
Their real advantage is allowing for much more advanced structures compared to CNC. If you just use 3D printing to copy something that would normally have been run through a CNC, you're already doing something wrong.
As a quick example, we use metal printed bits and drills specifically FOR CNC. While these items could be more cheaply produced conventionally, this allows us to have complex water cooling channels inside.",1,2026-01-10T14:24:26Z

Worse case, I had mine running in a single walled garage overnight and had no comments from my neighbours who are very close. The vacuum is generally louder but you don't have to run that with the 4th axis for instance. I also did leave it running overnight with a camera pointing at it with a smart switch ready to kill it if I saw anything on the camera. The length of job depends massively and a lot of the time could be reduced if you knew exactly what speeds and feeds to use. I 'wasted' a lot of time learning and had toolpaths that lasted days, probably because I was using very conservative settings. I'm sure I could save a lot of time by learning more myself.",1,2025-12-08T07:27:53Z

Lol seems there's too many variables to describe learning in a two dimensional curve. And what is on each axis? Time on X, Knowledge on Y? Wouldn't a steep curve be good as you're learning a lot quickly? Lol so i guess time is on the Y axis given steep learning curve usually means hard to learn... Or is it ""a lot to learn""? Is that really linear??  ""amount to learn"" is important... and difficulty to learn? Sure some things just take additional time to learn but some things are complicated and require intelligence to learn... I kinda think learning new software is about ""number of essential features""... And then it's about ""speed to learn essential features"" which combines with ""intuitiveness""... Usually a learning curve is a small amount of time to learn a large amount, then a lot of time to learn more complicated or specialised things but then ""care factor to learn"" comes in: if they're not essential features then you learn them if you want to put effort it to get the most out of something....

V-Ka02Ks4fM,UgzIX-PpYyib58KWwTR4AaABAg,,@zedzknight,"Hey, I have thought about your goals. You should look at a Barrister bookcase. I think it's the perfect place to start with the construction of this idea. Our First goal is to make a single roll dry storage box. With some 3d Printed parts, silicone calking (Type 2 would work, later in the comment, you need this type, it should be common worldwide.), and a Sheet material like Plexiglass, acrylic or any plastic sheeting. We can easily make a box capable of holding a single roll. This requires minimal tools, as you would need a drill, a straight edge, calking gun, and a utility knife. We can print corners that have slots to insert our sheets, which we secure using Silicone caulking. Most 1/4 inch or less Plastic sheeting can be scored and snapped.  Designing a 3d Printed Hinge for the door that gets pressed onto the edge like our corners do with Silicone to glue it in should work. For anyone worried that the silicone won't hold to the plastic, a little Sandpaper surface scuffing should make a solid hold. 3d printed Nerf guns hold a lot of air pressure when shooting. I'm sure silicone should hold moisture and the weight. We could further augment the design with local fasteners like M3 nuts and bolts. These are pretty common on a 3d printer, so if you have a printer, you probably can get these. As for the Door Seal, we could make a Proto-Putty Gasket. Proto-putty is simply Silicone type 2, with Cornstarch mixed in. Although Potato Starch or something similar may work as well. The King of Random YouTube Channel has a video on this. It was used to make a vacuum chamber seal and many other things. This could save a lot of people some hassle from having to use TPU if their machines can't use it. I'm sure we could print tools that would be great for making the perfect shape for protoputty seals. We may not even need to use proto putty if a design was made for the door, you could lay a bead of silicone down and, using a tool, create a shape on the door and the box to interface nicely. Latches could be added to create a better seal as well.

Then, using the single box design, we can expand horizontally with ease. With some added supports to create a barrister's box. Create a modular back plate that we can attach brackets for holding filament inside or stands that double as support. We could add some parts inside to direct the air flow to make a convection-style heating system. Maybe the standing brackets are curved in a way to promote circulation. Using some common fans found on our printers to push the air around. Then, on either end of the case, we can include Ports on the top and the bottom to allow our heating system to draw in air and exhaust it. Then becuase it's based on a Barrister's Box, you can stack another box on top to form a bookcase and attach the Exhaust to the intake to connect the drying system and loop it back to enclose it. We could include 3d printed desiccant filters that attach to the back plate, which could be set between each roll for improved moisture absorption from increased surface area or simply before the exhaust or the intake. They could even be a dedicated door to access the desiccant, so you are not letting moist air in.  The system works well, as you can modify your system as your needs change. Have PETG and PLA? Make the Dehydator modular to attach to the end of the box or be set inside, so your PETG and PLA can be routinely dehydrated separately. 

We could also use the Dry Break connector you designed, spaced out across the box, to let us attach to a roll without opening our box. I think this gives people the best chance at success, as filament rolls are all pretty consistent in Diameter. People can decide the length or the box they need, plus the Dehydrator. They can add modifications to the boxes, such as internal fans for convection, the drybreak, maybe a Filter box full of desicant, well recirculating air, or anything someone in the community can think of and add to an open-source set of prints. Someone could go crazy and design an automated filament driver to send any roll of filament up a bowden tube to be run to the printer. Then it can be placed on the shelves that can be locally bought and modified to accept any ducting to connect the many modular layers of the Barrister Boxes, or a system designed to interface and stack them as high as we safely can.

One of those has been a 1000 plus hour project, a much larger machine project is on my horizon. Filament management has  been an issue since day one.  Here is my idea for a community project. As a self proclaimed imagineer and 20 cad user I would join this team.

How about we take the drybox all the way. A quick change cassette style enclosure for filament. Sealed, desicant loaded,  rewind system, rfid tags for database management. Scalable dryer dock to ""recharge"" 1 or many cassettes. Incoperated mmu system. When you load a spool into a cassette, feed filament into a sealed drive path system thats driven from an the mmu. The configurable and scalable mmu will have dock bays that you just load cassettes into. Could even have a maintenance type dryer. From a single bay buffer feed to a 2 bay for single color auto reload, multi color cut and poop, or a tool/nozzle swapper. Loading to the mmu dock aligns the feed and rewind couplers and syncs the rfid. Loading onto the dryer syncs the rfid to tag last dry cycle. Digital humidty sensor system linked to database. Rfid system sync to klipper to manage inventory.",0,2026-01-10T21:21:14Z

Using clay-based desiccants I've been able to not just store nylons and be ready to use but lower the humidity to 5% RH in my filament changing boxes by using one of the spool slots for desiccant in addition to a desicant tumbler that goes in the center of the spool.

I've been working on a dry cabinet... Not to dry my filament, I do that with a food dehydrator, but to keep it dry. This is currently only a plan, I've not started building yet, because I'm moving house soon...

So far my design has a microcontroller (arduino), connected to a switch, humidity\heat sensor*2 and a fan.

If the humidity in the body of the cabinet goes above 10% (needs tuning) and the door switch is closed, it'll run a fan blowing air through a desiccant cartridge. until the humidity drops again.

There will also be a humidity sensor just past the desiccant cartridge. So if the air coming out the cartridge is too humid, it'll alert me that its time to change the cartridge and redry the desiccant. 

My design still needs a lot of work before I'm happy with it... for example, I'm considering adding heating elements, to warm the air up to 40c to help dry filament... but not sure on that one yet.",0,2025-12-27T17:12:55Z

I personally started building a drybox solution based heavily off of GunplaMark's ""The Ultimate Cereal Container Filament Drybox - Official Remix"" found on Printables. My objective is simply to have a collection that can be neatly organized against a wall. However, I can see that same wall also working for the backing of a cabinet and I can also see a robot arm vending machine selector as an over the top add on that might work better with the closed cabinet of 2, but could also work with the open wall mount system of 1. That way you have a versatile system with which anyone can build the part that they like as they go. Any combination should work. 1+2, 1+3, 2+3 and 1+2+3.

And the icing on the cake would be if all the spools are on a pole or sitting on wheels that allow them to spin and if they could all feed their filaments through small holes that I would just pull on to use them directly without ever having to open the door or pull the reel out. I'm picturing a bunch of small holes with the tip of the filament sticking out just a little either on the side or on the top around my printer sitting in the center of all those filaments. That'd be really cool. I was thinking about this because I'm about to get a Snapmaker U1 and it has no AMS like my current BL P1S so I could just pull on 4 colors I want to use and just feed them directly into the printer and when I'm done I can just push it back in and pull on another one.

If you create positive warm dry air displacement at the top of the unit and push this to the bottom where the filament is accessed, this limits the ingress of moisture. Carousels are used in industry for part retrieval systems. So a combo using lab based positive air displacement principles and a desiccant to polish the last of the moisture out might be a good way to maintain the filament.  Then just bring out the filament when it’s require in the print queue to get out the remaining moisture.

Once closed inside you remove your hands from the gloves and open the drawer from the outside and get your spool.

It’d be nice to see a modular solution that could exist on a set standard of space. You could then create generators similar to gridfinity. You’d have to separate the drying, desiccant, and storage into separate values. This way it could adapt to whatever containers you could fit into whatever is available. Using a generator would help keep the administrative work down while creating a successful, widely available, and logistically possible system.

I just wonder if 2 could be combined somehow with somewhat sealed drawers for each roll so that you can, even without a carousel as mentioned in 3, you can easily pick a single roll without changing much for the other rolls in the system.

V-Ka02Ks4fM,UgxMYpxIN_PUkNJ7Ytp4AaABAg,,@IanBradbury,"2 and 3.

Currently I have +200 spools all 1kg (I do have 3 or 4 3kg but I'm not stressing about those) so if there is a cabinet involved I am sure I'd need several - so.... cabinets that can be placed close to each other without impeding access to the spools would be a must.

Thinking about the issue of opening a cabinet and allowing damp air inside.... maybe. the cabinet is actually a series of smaller cabinets, stacked and connected, so air escape/ingress is minimised.  I like the idea is stacked smaller cabinets as it could make assembly easier and cheaper.  Cabinets that have some ducting that connects via magnets and have valves that open/close as the cabinet doors are opened.  Maybe.

This is a great project idea.",8,2025-11-18T09:03:41Z

V-Ka02Ks4fM,UgyalfaH9-mpRe3YklJ4AaABAg,,@markmorgan7370,"I think it would be good to combine option 1 with the others, so you would have an individual dry box for each spool, that would act as a cassette, or cartridge that will slot into the larger cabinet or vending machine. For storage or drying, but can be printed from directly when removed.

Maybe then you can separate the drying and maintenance responsibilities, with the cassette holding some dessicate, but the cabinet or vending machine having a dryer that the cassettes connect to when stored",2,2025-11-18T08:19:31Z

I run a small etsy store, so I have at large number of spools in various colors and materials that all spend different amounts of time waiting for their turn on the printer. PLA is the biggest offender in this case, because while it won't *really* absorb a lot of moisture, it will become brittle from too much exposure. A large, or at least modular cabinet-style solution would be great, as that would allow me to maintain a stable environment for long-term storage without having to put up with the hassle of vacuum bags or have dozens of spools in individual dryboxes. 
A quick note on the drybox idea; I definitely think a hybrid approach here is the way to go. You could very easily make a fully 3D printable (see Moby Motion's video on the subject for proof of concept), or modified commercial solution (like a cereal container) that fits onto the polydryer. This would solve the cost issue of the Polymaker solution, while keeping the usefulness of the removable drybox. I think it's definitely going to be necessary for most practical applications to keep the more expensive and highly hygroscopic filaments in their own sealed containers, and use bulk storage for things that aren't as sensitive. Think, big carousel style sealed cabinets for PLA, but a simple shelf with dryboxes for the more sensitive filaments. You won't need to invest a lot of effort into a big fancy all in one solution when the bulk of the material people are printing with doesn't really need active drying in the first place.
That being said I'm a sucker for a big over-engineered solution, so you do you. I'll still want to see it, lol.",0,2025-11-17T23:56:07Z

I saw your video reviewing it and thought that, like you, it could be extended with multiple boxes stacked up….but having just seen your connector it would open up the ability to have a broader base of boxes with stacking, being fed from a single heater with a modified base piping the heat to all the “base boxes” then allowing the heat to rise up to any stacked boxes places on top. For example 1 heater, 3 bases and 2 layers would give 6 boxes in total (each box holds 2 1kg spools) = 12 spools. Only issue is there is only one heater with a source so everything is heated to the same temp.

1) Storage: It should be Modular. How about a modular system of single spool containers that can be put side by side and stacked on one another, while still being accessible when needed for printing from.  
2) Drying: This depends on howmany spools you would need to dry at any given time. It should however be scalable. What if the containers could somehow be interlocked to use a single heating/drying element so that more than one container could be dried at a time? Maybe upto say four containers at a time.
3) Printing: You should be able to print from the containers without having to open them.

Not too long ago, I wanted to understand what was causing PLA to become brittle over time.  My first guess was that it was exposure to oxygen over time, but according to what I've read, it's actually moisture in the air that causes the polymers to break and lose strength.  According to this, there's permanent damage done to PLA exposed to humid air, so using a solution that only has an inline dryer is not going to resolve all aspects of the humidity problem -- unless you don't use PLA (or other material with the same problem).

As a kid in the 90's, we had opportunities to see what they were doing via bring your child to work days.  At the time, almost all mass storage was either optical or magnetic.  They had some incredible machines that would store, find, transport, and read 10, 50, or even thousands of drives.  One that comes to mind of this project was a bit like the star wars data storage systems seen in various places.  It was a wall of drives on a series of conveyors that would move the drives to the reader.  It was a simple but elegant system.  Others were able to find and read multiple drives by taking them off the wall with a ""claw"" and putting it into one of many readers.  Others has huge robotic arms (you know the ones that build cars?) that could rapidly access thousands of drives over a huge distance.  

I am envisioning a wall of spools with filament tubes running from each, kind of like a giant AMS.  I saw an aftermarket multi-filament adapter for my AD5M Pro that had multiple filaments connected right to the print head.  What about a MASSIVE version of that, right at the top of the printer, with 'all' of the filament in the storage box connected via tubes from the storage cabinet.  IF we are talking a full scale, print farm ready version of this thing, it could have a rewind function at every spool (or a mobile rewinder) to pull the filament back from the print head minimizing waste during filament changes.  

Or if we want to go full sci-fi a robot that takes the filament rolls into a standard 4 spool AMS to be fed to a stock changer.  or the manual version of that, have those rubber gloves that go into the door of the cabinet allowing you to manually switch rolls without opening the cabinet.",1,2025-12-22T22:27:06Z

Create one each for all of your options. Then just program the tag with one of those (which were pre-created) and stick it on the spool. Then enter a numbered location into a responsive web app that tracks filament. Would work on phone, tablet or laptop that way.

y4W8Kr6shVU,UgwsRNkufcAbLgXk7_F4AaABAg,,@nickhancock589,"I live in coastal South Carolina, so the humidity can be a significant factor most of the year. I started early by storing my filament in Sterilite gasket boxes. The seal isn't particularly tight, but a gentle pressure on the gasket is all that's needed to keep the humidity out.
Eventually I started using Eva-Dry units. They are a bit expensive, but are very convenient to recharge and that worked better than printed boxes that need to be checked, emptied, recharged, and then put back into the container. If it's too onerous, then it won't get done regularly like it should and these things helped. My dry boxes would register in the teens or twenties humidity wise with these. Then I hit on another excellent desiccant.
I started using Activated Alumina a few months ago for humidity control and it has worked very well. I pour the beads into a small metal powder shaker that can fit into the middle of most filament reels when they are in my AMS unit and can be popped into a small toaster oven to recharge at 350 Fahrenheit for a few hours.  By itself, the activated alumina will get the humidity down to about the upper twenties for humidity, but if you put an Eva-Dry unit into the box the humidity goes much lower and then the alumina alone will suffice to keep the humidity that low.
When I open a gasket box to get a reel out, the humidity level jumps up, but quickly returns to the previous level after the box has been shut for a few minutes. I surmise that this incidental exposure to humidity does no real harm if the box is not left open for an extended time. The small volume of air trapped in the box does not contain a sufficient quantity of moisture to make a difference in the quality of filament performance during printing or significantly reduce the time between needing to recharge the desiccant.

Edit: - I forgot to mention the best dryer idea I've seen in action. On the Samcraft youtube channel he uses a commercial food dehydrator to process a large number of filament reels at once. The Ausegia Commercial Large 12 Trays Food Dehydrator, Usable Area up to 22.67ft², 1200W Full Stainless Steel Dryer Machine, up to 190℉ Temperature, for Meat, Fruit, Veggies, Beef, Herbs, Pet Foods runs about $220 - $250 on Amazon.

Reviewing what others did (like CNC Kitchen and Made with layers, among others) will help get ideas and lessons learnt rather than reinventing the wheel. Especially a follow up on CNC Kitchen's solid state dehydrator. Maybe it's cheaper/more viable now.
A collaboration with any of them might also be a good idea. Maybe with Lost in Tech sine he might be close to you? Just a thought.
I also have an idea that might work for people with more filament than I do: some sort of a vending machine. You don't open the whole container. You just push the one you're interested in out. I don't have an idea for how to reload conveniently though without reopening the whole thing. Alternatively, maybe tiny doors for each filament slot? I don't know.
Another idea that might work for me is keeping everything in readily available AMS units connected to electricity only to keep filament dry, but not necessarily connected to a printer. That's provided there are cheap enough ones out there to keep this reasonable.

y4W8Kr6shVU,UgwuJ4K8IhphPJlcstx4AaABAg,,@christopherlyons7613,"Interesting project. I have a small print farm and have been playing around with ideas for this for the past year. I generally have about 300 rolls in stock with rolls being used up and replaced weekly. My current setup is far from perfect but I feel it is at least a reasonable start.

Here’s what I currently do. First I use Sterlite air tight containers for storage (these aren’t perfect and tend to break handles after repeated use but they are easy to fix when necessary). These come in a variety of sizes and are reasonably priced with discounts available for bulk purchases. They are nice because they have a foam seal and plastic clips that push the cover into the seal to keep it fairly air tight. I’ve standardized on the larger size which holds about 20 rolls. These are nice since they are stackable with molded rides on top/bottom so they stay together when stacked. I label each with either filament type & manufacturer or specific type (like Rainbow PLA or Marble PLA). I also designed desiccant holders that screw into the hub of each roll so the inside of the containers stay dry. I use 512 byte NFC tags attached to the desiccant holder and the roll to track info about each. For filament NFCs I store filament type & brand, color, basic print info (nozzle temp range, bed temp range, print speed range), purchase date, price, vendor, etc.. I also store the date of the last dry session. For desiccant holders I store the date it was loaded, # of drys and last dry date (these get dried with the roll). So I can access most info about rolls & desiccant holders with a quick scan of the associated NFCs. When I see desiccant has not been dried within 6 weeks, I replace it with fresh desiccant, update the NFC and put the old desiccant into a container which gets dried and the process restarts.

I also maintain a ChatGPT filament inventory system and log new rolls when they arrive and remove rolls when they are done. I can search for rolls by filament type, color, age and a host of other ways as needed. I also store the name of the Sterlite container where it’s stored. When starting a new print I typically research my inventory and determine which rolls I’m going to use and then get the set of info for each roll so I can locate it. I check the NFC to see if it needs drying before the print and if so load into one of my 4 roll dryers before printing. I update the filament & desiccant NFCs if drying is completed so all data stays current. This also allows me to calculate filament costs per print reasonably accurately since the slicer will tell me the amount used and I know the roll price from the NFCs data (I also enter this into the filament profile cost field (I use Orca & Bambu Studio) so the slicer can tell me costs directly). I do multi color prints using single AMS units (max of 4 filaments per print) and studio takes care of figuring out the costs for each print based on my filament selections. 

This works pretty well for my printing tasks but there are some downsides. First, it’s sometimes hard to locate a roll if it gets misplaced into the wrong storage container. I know where it’s supposed to be but if not found then I have to search around to find it. Obviously none of this is automatic, so I have to manually find and load rolls needed before each print. 

Interested in what others think of this system and ways it could be improved. It’s been working fairly well for me but could certainly be improved.",7,2025-10-27T03:59:00Z

y4W8Kr6shVU,UgxAOSPU0S_YPFLyR7F4AaABAg,,@markbooth3066,"We've been looking for a better solution for a while. We're currently using a mix of vacuum bags and round tubs (mostly 2000ml with some 2500ml round tubs for those annoyingly wide spools some manufacturers like). Each bag/tub has in in hub desicant holder, and a hygrometer in a frame that clips onto a spool edge and has a flat surface we can write details on. This allows us to read out what the humidity of a spool is and details of the filament (e.g. eSun PLA Green) without having to look at the side of the spool or open the bag/tub. The problem is that the tubs don't sit upright on their side, and vacuum bags have all those awkward vacced down corners that get in the way of sitting on their rims.

I started printing some rack modules, but realised they were going to take far too much filament to do enough for all our filament, plus there wasn't enough of a height gap for the tubs, or vacuum packed filaments without those pesky corners getting stuck all of the time. So then I though about building adjustable frames using 2020 extrusion, but that would have cost far too much. What I think we need is a combination of stock material for length & strength (what reprap called vitamins *8') and 3d printed parts to abstract away the complexity and fabrication hassle. Maybe the solution is a minimal 2020 frame and some sort of per spool hanger, then hanging the spools on that, like you hang clothes in a wardrobe.

A storage system with tracking would be interesting though. If every spool and location had a QR code, they could be scanned in and out of different locations. Developing and self hosting a local database web service wouldn't be too difficult and could take a lot of drudgery out of managing a large collection. Scanning and launching those qrcodes would open a local url's to request changes to the database, for example scan the QR code for spool ESPLAGR1, it might open a webpage saying ""Moving spool eSun PLA Green 1 from Rack 1 Row 2 to?"" then a scan of code AMS3 and it would say ""Moved spool eSun PLA Green 1 moved to AMS lite spool 3"". You could even supply additional data for certain moves, such as scanning spool BLGAL1 and DRYER1's QR code it could say ""Spool Bambu Labs Galaxy Purple PLA 1 moved to Elegoo Dryer, use 50°C for 8 hours"" etc.

Oh, and you're wrong about the spreadsheet, btw. Our filament storage may still be a mess, but at least we now know what we haven't got in stock as well as what's on our ""never buy this again"" list. *8')",0,2025-10-27T00:58:35Z

For example, if there was a standard qr-code or NFC- Tag the manufacturers would use that could simply be scanned adding the relevant Information this would be helpfull.",5,2025-10-26T18:57:21Z

There are some youtube videos on how the work, especially fascinating is the mechanical memory that let people choose multiples of upcoming songs while something else is playing.  During the cold war (I promise this is going somewhere) they were flying C-130s and to atmospheric sampling to keep tabs on what the Russians were doing.   They sucked  stratosphere air through paper filters and analyzed the dust when back on the ground.   They needed to change the filter out every X minutes (don't honestly know) so they made them the same size as 45rpm records, and repurposed the mechanism from a juke box....it worked great, and saved months/years of design work. This monitoring still happens. Then around AD2000 the filter changers all eventually wore out and there are no more jukeboxes being made, and the tooling etc. is long lost.   So there was a MASSIVE engineering project to re/reverse engineer a mechanism that would accomplish the task....and is wasn't easy or cheap.

Of course it doesn't solve most of the problems you mentioned, but it avoids stacking, I can see what's in the box (even though the plastic is slightly ""frosted"").  I have a humidistat hot-glued on the inside facing out (don't need to cut a hole), and use a scoop of calcium chloride in largish tea infuser bag to keep the humidty around 10%..  If I were to scale it up, I'd probably start using numbering system with a spreadsheet to keep track of what's where.  Also use a kitchen scale to weigh the box (or spool), to keep track of roughly how much is left. 

At my scale using a mechanical rack system for selecting a box would be way overkill, but I could see at about 100 boxes is starts looking attractive.  Maybe when you put a box of filament on the loading platform of the unit, it would get automatically weighed, and you could put an RFID tag on the box so that the machine knows which box's weight to update in the database.

The Eddie current flow sensor is cheap and bad compared to LiDAR, they ditched the carbon X axis surely due to cost, making the motion system way heavier.
The quick nozzle swap is an upgrade if you change nozzles a lot, but everything else is worse or equal.
From what I have seen print quality is a little worse as you would expect, with the bad flow calibration and heavier motion system.

This is to say that is a normal thing printing TPU 60-70 Sh.A with truly good results by using professional FDM 3D printer, so if you need certain shore hardness you need proper hardware, not snubbing very soft TPU just because our cheap hardware can't manage it.

So far Filaflex 60A has been the best in terms of grip - but it's extremely challenging to print with. Between the usual TPU/TPE 85-95A, it seems to be more of a issue how matte the surface is, as softer rubbers can perform worse if the surface has a slightly matte finish. Will try Filaflex SEBS soon.

I have been printing several things for practical uses, PLA seems to prone to brittleness, PETG is darn near perfect for most ridged body things, however it still is too brittle when using it on very thin, or spindly prints, so I turned to TPU, I very much enjoyed it's near indestructability from impact and delamination, but it was too soft for ridged body prints, I found some sooper hard 72D TPU, and it is the definition of frustration, but the stuff is SO tough, I printed a test cube and took it to my anvil and hit it with a piece of metal, it left a mark but nothing more.

It also will print out of an AMS, which is nice since I'm in a totally different building from my printer.
I've heard it prints a lot like nylon, I've never printed with nylon, or most materials for that matter, I am not big into 3d printing as a hobby, instead as a means for my other hobbies.
It's resistant to cutting, essentially impact impervious, is strong in thin parts, prints cleanly, but I've had a few troubles with layer adhesion, when printed well it has a high layer adhesion, when the print goes wrong, it can delaminate, I suspect I'm having temp troubles, I'm still getting it dialed in.

I see TPU, as of right now, the best material to print tough parts, especially thin ones, I hate the slow extrusion, but it's a worthy tradeoff, I want a hard material yet that can bend and not break.",12,2025-10-09T06:48:24Z

I wish there were more options for hard TPU like this, when it's just 1 company making it, it worries me they'll discontinue it or something.

Pt2j2BWcAqM,UgxNX-G7g1WMSSS00pd4AaABAg,,@Raven-Creations,"I'll probably stick with TPU for most projects, but it's nice to have options, especially where they have such different properties.  TPU is both cheap and quite cheerful and it's pretty predictable, so once you're used to it, you don't need lots of test prints.  I particularly like the foaming TPU, which allows you to vary the shore hardness by changing the nozzle temperature.  This allows you to do things like print progressive rate buffers for end-stops, or you can create feet for equipment with relatively hard soles but a spongy interior to absorb impacts.

What would be interesting to know, is the bonding strength of these materials with other filament.  For instance, Functional Print Friday (FPF) has found that using PLA as support for TPU prints can work well, but its adhesion seems to be temperature dependent.  On small test prints it works like a charm, but on larger prints it fails because the PLA or TPU has cooled down too much by the time the next layer is laid down.  PETG seems to have a similar property, but at different temperatures, so it may work where PLA fails.

FPF also found that the bond strength of TPU on PLA was not the same as PLA on TPU.  This might also boil down to temperature.  If PLA is printed much faster than TPU, you have hot PLA being laid onto cool TPU, then hot TPU laid onto still-warm PLA, creating different bond strengths between the layers.  With enough information, we would be able to tune which materials to use based on print size and temperatures.


I think it's great that so much development is going into filament composition.  It's not that long since we only had PLA or ABS as viable options.  Now, we have a huge range of possibilities and our printers are capable of printing exotic materials too.  3d-printing has matured a lot in the last decade.  It's no longer the preserve of congenital tweakers, who manage to get a good print on the sixth attempt.  Now ""normal"" people can get good results on their first attempt.  I can't wait to see what the next decade has in store for us.",10,2025-10-07T16:20:39Z

This is one of the main reasons why, when recommissioning a car, you turn it over by hand to get all the surfaces and seals fully oiled up before putting them under any stress.
Considering how little filament they use, it's worth trying, and see if you get a good seal.  If they're being used for something important, you'd want to test them first anyway.
Note that there are some materials (I can't remember which, but I think they were fairly exotic), which shrink as they absorb water.

However, the structure BEHIND the surface rubber could be a good candidate. Currently it's rubber pips adhered to layer of ""sponge"" AKA foam.

A real world application is something like 3d printed tires for RC or model cars. TPU seems to have the right softness, but it just slips and it's effectively unusable. 

The solution to this for making them at home so far was 3d printing what amounts to a template, taking a silicon mold from it and then using that to cast the final tire.

rNMW-fXrZYo,Ugz0fs6DBEgSLCPx9sd4AaABAg,,@RyonBeachner,"I’m going to comment as someone who bought one of these for business use. 

I print almost exclusively nylon PAHT-CF, PA12-CF, PA6-CF and PA12 Support (PA12 without any infill so far as I can tell) and I need to be able to anneal the parts to prevent warping and provide adequate dimensional stability for the entire service life of the part, where it will be exposed to varying levels of humidity. 

This is the only dryer I was able to find that allows me to dry these materials at their suggested temperatures, print from the dryer for longer production runs without worry of filament re-wetting over the course of a print, and also provide an annealing solution that doesn’t require manual control of an oven. 

For everyone who is saying this is over priced, you are not the target audience. If you’re primarily printing PLA and PETG, there is no reason to get one of these, it’s complete overkill and would be downright idiotic when you have so many cheaper solutions that will be just fine for you. If you’re dealing with more hygroscopic filaments that require drying temperatures over 70c, this is one of very few options on the market from a trusted brand capable of getting the job done.",0,2026-01-19T08:14:03Z

My only gripe is that I think it heats up a bit too quickly for annealing, so I usually start the process on a lower temperature and ramp it up manually over time and also put the parts in fine sand to work as a kind of heat sink to distribute the heat more evenly and to reduce warping.

To me the asking price is worth not dealing with the headaches of using the kitchen oven and microwave and having to clean them constantly. A specialized tool to do the job properly is always a good way to go.",2,2025-11-06T11:49:46Z

Jeremy @FigureFeedback showed how to do it in a video that he released today.  However, there shouldn't be a cloud service.  I don't do anything in the cloud and I definitely don't want any part of 3D printing through someone's cloud.  Ditto for the proprietary re-skinned OrcaSlicer.  I'm not doing that, either.

I was initially very impressed with the IFS and the general design of the AD5X.  I print a lot of TPU for my business so I was initially impressed by the claim that the AD5X would allow multi-color 95A durometer TPU printing.  FlashForge backed off that claim but it still does mostly work and would probably work well for my applications that swap filaments only rarely per part.

The AD5X is the best hardware implementation I've seen of using multiple filaments multiplexed into a single print head, but I'm not a fan of those poopy designs.  I'm waiting to see how the Bondtech INDX syatem works in reality.  Having a single extruder and swapping the heater and nozzle allows printing with incompatible filaments rather than simply changing colors of PLA, and there is no poop.

kW8Jy09-ns4,UgzUYfmqy9mHCAX4hVN4AaABAg,,@donnyriggz,"tldr; An inferior attempt to clone the Bambu A1 into a cheap Core-XY. Not recommended when there are better alternatives.

Great review. Glad you didn't hold back on the many issues this printer has as many other reviews I've seen are glossing over these issues. I pre-orderd by in November and have had my unit since February and have experience many of the same problems. I view this printer as a worse in every way A1 with a price to match that inferiority. The IFS itself isn't anything revolutionary and is less capable than the feeders on the AMS Lite often having trouble pulling filaments with even the slightest amount of resistance.

The build volume is 220x220, but it uses a 235x235 build plate so you can use any Ender sized bild plate, you just can't use all of it.

I do not recommend using 95A TPU through the IFS. It will have frequent feeding issues and jams in the extruder especially on multi-color prints. I only got a couple Multi-Material TPU prints to finish successfully and even single color TPU prints failed over 50% of the time.

Be very careful unplugging the extruder. It connects to very tiny pins on the extruder board and can easily rip those out if you pull too hard or at an angle. I'm still waiting on a replacement board nearly a month after submitting my service request.

You can use other slicers (standard Orca, etc), but there is no way to control the IFS for multi-color prints so it just uses slot 1 of the IFS. If you want to do multi-color, at least for now, you have to use their slicer. My biggest issue there is that they don't display the flush amount when slicing, just a total material usage.

I got the FlashForge camera and it's terrible especially when there is no light on the bed. It doesn't even point at the bed correctly so you can't see half the plate. Maybe this is because it was designed for the AD5M and the mounting point is different on the AD5X?

One of my biggest issues with this printer is whenever I opened a 3mf created with BambuSlicer it would ignore any filament selections it carried and just print as a single color print from the most recently used IFS slot. It would not recognize the filament types as being valid, even if I changed them, so would just panic and pick a random slot and start printing, ignoring any color changes.

I also had problems after the last firmware update where the printer would just stop mid-print as if it experienced a power failure, then it would report that the print was finished and fail to resume printing. This happened so many times in a row and at different points in the print, that I just stopped using it entirely, until they release a firmware update fixing this issue.

Flashforge has released plans to print a full enclosure for the AD5X including the top, but they are not selling the hardware kit yet. I just used a 3rd party ""tent"" enclosure though and it worked pretty good. It was designed for the A1 and had holes in the side to run the PTFE through. I tried running lines out the side to my Sunlu S4 and got mediocre results, the holes are a bit too high on the side causing a very poor filament path which creates a lot of resistance especially with very full spools. There is just enough room to run the filaments on the side spool holders though.

The AD5X is much louder than either my A1 or P1 printers, by a fair margin. Both the fans and movements cause more noise. Also I started getting rough patches on my X and Y rails after only a couple months of light use. Likely because like you said it lacks proper lubrication. Another build quality issue is the little flap that holds the hot end in is very thin and weak. It bent the very first time I tried to remove the hot and and feels very flimsy, unlike the one on the A1.

There are some things to like about this printer. For example, it uses an A1 style poop try and flings the poop out the back of a short, open poop shoot. This avoids the main issue I have with my P1s where it dumps directly into the shoot and often gets stuck on the flap, eventually building up and overflowing into the machine. I don't see this being an issue with the AD5X, and I praise them for that design. The filament change times are also roughy 20 seconds faster than the A1 and almost a minute faster than the P1, which can add up to a lot of time savings on prints with lots of color changes.

I listed my printer for sale trying to offload it before the full launch, but then a potential buyer asked to see it running which is when I ran into the jammed extruder and broke the extruder board. Now I'm stuck with a paperweight that I can't sell for anything close to what I paid for and still waiting on FF support to ship me the parts I need to fix it.

As it stands currently, until they can fix their issues, I do not recommend this printer when the A1 Mini combo is the same price (slightly smaller build area) or for a little more you can get the A1 combo with a larger build volume. If you don't like Bambu, the Creality Hi or the Anycubic Kobra 3 combo are better alternatives (Kobra 3 is currently $349 for the combo).",0,2025-06-11T14:32:25Z

It ran into an error, corrupted, factory reset, can't bind again, serial number if abcdefg. So I gave up flashforge orca slicer. Used original orca slicer. It was very easy. Just pick the model from devices, set the correct IP (I used both WiFi and LAN, both worked perfectly). I'm thinking of installing Klipper CFW to minimize waste. After all done, I tried their flexible PLA, it made the extruder stuck (my mistake when switching from petg to pla I've selected PLA as the new filament which wasn't hot enough to remove old PETG), I had to completely disassemble the whole extruder unit to fix this (it went deep in). This was my very first time ever learning about 3D printing and starting it. But I've managed to get everything done by myself without ever needing anyone's help and learned everything in hard way. I specifically choose 5M pro above any other printer is because the built in HEPA filter which is very important to as I'm concerned about health effects. I haven't found this feature in any other printer (I have no problem affording high end printers but non of them had feature). I know I should've been pissed at flashforge for giving me such a hard time but it was very well built and if you're resourceful, you can tackle all those things and get behind this well made printer. The software is messed up but as a software engineer, I didn't had any problem with switching from vendor locking sw. As a person who never even watched a single video of 3D printing before trying it by myself, I can assure this printer is very beginner friendly. 
It's been a week now and I made so many flawless prints with different materials and switching materials in between prints, switching different nozzles, etc and not a single print failed even when I brought cheap petg for testing.",1,2025-07-01T21:38:41Z

Not worth the headache. 

The spool holders this printer shipped with the early release models absolutely cannot use all spools well. Cardboard spools sit at a weird angle and the edges of the spool rub against the holder, if it's one of the top spools it drops ground bits of cardboard onto the spools below it. This also causes a lot of resistance which the IFS doesn't handle well at all throwing out frequent errors because it can't feed the filament. Also most mini-spools also do not fit. You would also need different spool adapters for this printer as well and the new spool holders are basically copying the A1 style and will also likely not fit all spools.",2,2025-06-11T14:38:08Z

This also wastes a LOT of filament (!)   Why can't this be solved by extending hot end changeover time?

I am the type to do a bit of over analysis and it is not easy to compare these different brands of dryers to each other as it is not entirely clear what type of setup works the best, both ease of use but also the performance of the device itself.  

It would be nice if there was a standardized way to test one of these, things like quantified weight before and weight after drying or graph of temp and humidity over time or a weight and tensile test on a 3 inch long sample before and after drying. With samples taken from the top, bottom, outside and inside of the spool.  Standardizing the testing would be key to truly comparing and evaluating these devices.

- Install an Omron SSR if you live in a 110v country before your OEM SSR melts (look up ""Omron SSR Plus 4"").

I've  had a 3D print farm for the last 8 years and have tried many different printers over the years. About 6 years ago I bought two Qidi fully enclosed printers based on rave reviews on YouTube. I tried them out for a month and could never get the printers to print ABS with any decent surface quality plus they both had multiple mid print software issues. Luckily I had bought them on Amazon so returning them was not an issue. During the month I had contacted Qidi multiple times about both the print quality and the software glitches and went around and around with them. They expect you to wait for parts that they want to send you to fix their guess at what the problems are and also to basically rebuild brand new printers.

Then, last year (2024) I foolishly gave them another chance based on the multiple great reviews on their Qidi X-Max3 large format printer. I foolishly made the mistake of buying the printer directly from the Qidi website. I received the printer in good shape and got a couple of good ABS prints before the error messages started occurring mid print. I contacted Qidi and they sent me a ton of replacement parts to fix my NEW PRINTER. I had to install a replacement BL Touch (actually a cheap Chinese clone), communication and power cables from the mother board to the print head, replacement printhead cover with additional cooling fan, chamber heater fan and heat element, etc. Then install/flash new firmware. Guess what, after about 4 hours later and a ton of work the printer still had the error messages as soon as the print chamber warmed up! I contacted them again and told them that I wanted to return the printer for a full refund and their VERY INSISTANT response was we'll send you more parts (inductive probe to replace the BL touch for bed leveling). At this point I didn't want to waste any more time on their defective product plus Changing to an inductive probe meant installing a magnetic sheet over the printers nice magnetic bed and losing build height. No matter what I said they would not agree to take their printer back and give me a refund. I finally had to file for a chargeback with my credit card company to get my $1000 back ( I had to send them the entire email chain showing that I had asked Qidi over 15 times for a refund and a shipping label to return the printer).

It’s the small details that define the level of quality put into a product, and the fact that the wiring was hidden where most users would never see it—only to be so poorly executed—speaks volumes about Qidi’s integrity. I want a printer from a company that takes pride in their work, ensuring every detail is clean and well-executed, even the ones that go unseen. I sure hope they’re not building vehicles.

It’s a shame, too. When you printed with PPS-CF and I saw the high-quality results, I was ready to place an order on the spot. But thanks to your honest review, I know what I’d really be getting.

For me as a Plus4 owner it's very obvious that you, Ricky, did not really spent much time with the Plus4. There are so many well know flaws besides the SSR gate, which are not mentioned here. And also in case of the malfunctioning 110V SSR, QIDI's solution is not fully satisfying: Due to the issues QIDI rolled out a new firmware for all variants (110V and 220V), just lowering the power for the chamber heater. So, while fixing the 110V issues, the actual Plus4's don't have the originallay advertised 400W chamber heater any more, as the power is limited (to a power factor of 40%) by FW update.

Further, you mention the active carbon filter, which is by design not suitable for filtering. It's advertised by QIDI as a ""chamber circulation (!)"" with active carbon filtration. If it would have been implemented as ""circulation"" it would make sense. In fact it's just an exhaust fan, directly blowing the warm air out of the housing into the room, with minimal contact time for the air to be filtered. There are mods already available, to make it circulating, but the stock implementation does not make sense at all.

Besides that the auxiliary fan is BS by design. On the one hand side it's not recommended for larger models due to the one sided air flow. More critical is, that it counteracts to the cooling fan from cold end of the print head, leading to clogging for certain materials like PETG. Then there are massive issues with bed leveling and nozzles scratching through the build plate, due to either defective piezo sensors or due to a very special modification by QIDI of the klipper based firmware.

Don't get me wrong: after spending much time with the Plus4 and optimizing things, the Plus4 is a great printer. But the ""review"" of this video is nothing more than going through the official specification.",10,2025-03-05T23:30:44Z

Dont have a huge budget so affordability is awesome. Especially since the quality and ability is damn near industrial level. I have no complaints. Well, one, but its minor.

If you get a filament clog or run out of filament mid print, the language used for some of the options can be confusing. The proper way to continue involves going to the control screen and hitting the play button. But if you mistakingly hit ""load filament"" like youd think you would need to after you ran out, it will go through the homing sequence and start to probe the bed, which is no bueno if you have a print sitting in the middle of the bed. Luckily, even in a ""oh shit"" moment i was able to open the door and pull the PEI sheet off the bed as the nozzle was slow motion coming to destroy the print lol.

I did a couple things at once so I'm not too sure what made a difference but if you get one and or some else is having issues:

I loosened the bed tramming knobs and leveled it with cheps ez 3d light lvl sensor 
Replaced the bed sensors and aux boards
Changed some code in the config file as per supports suggestion (I don't think it did anything tbh)
And I reflashed the firmware via USB and reset to factory defaults 

After this it was no longer digging the nozzle into the bed on a cold print but was being finicky with prints if it was already warm which is an issue for engineering prints but theirs a mod online that makes it so the chamber temp sensor is more accurate it's literally a copy and paste ordeal and I've been printing PC like it's pla​

Don't get me wrong, for the price and with it's features and build volume it was and is a bargain. But the new ceramic heatbrake is prone to breaking when the nozzle gets hung on the PEI wiper, the chamber heater has reduced output which means it takes a very long time to heat up the chamber for filaments like ASA for example, the location of the chamber temperature sensor causes inaccurate readings that can lead to some dangerous temperatures in the chamber, the hotend fan duct is offset resulting in poor cooling, the peizo sensors are failing frequently due to heat, and there are problems with the inductive bed probes due to heat as well. So if you plan to consistently print filaments that require high bed temperatures you may need a lot of mods/upgrades to get stable performance from the Plus 4. While you may not have encountered some of these issues, there is a Discord Plus 4 group, a Plus 4 Github group, and multiple FB groups with ample info on these issues and more. Personally I am having z offset inconsitency and I'm having the retram the bed daily or my 1st layer gets way too squished, and it takes forever to heat up the chamber. Other than that I am quite happy with my plus 4. I am planning to mod the chamber heater enclosure, do the Dynamic Chamber Temperature Manager mod, and change the behavior of the bed mesh macro, as well as printing a better hotend fan duct.

The bed leveling piezos I haven't heard any issues with, but there was a out of box gcode offset issue they had when the printer was new that caused the issue you're describing.  That has been corrected.  The house fire was most likely an old chamber heater left installed, which while not an excuse for a housefire, this has been corrected on new models.  Agreeably we need more info on that particular case.  

As far as I know the K2 basically can't make it out the box without problems.  Firmware issue sprinkled with endless hardware issues.

Also, the Reddit user with the house fire stated they had the new SSR installed and weren't even using the chamber heater when the fire occurred. But I agree that we'll have to wait and see how much truth there is to any of those claims.

The old one broke frequently sure, but the new one certainly hasn't.  They also replace any broken nozzles.  And what I meant by a wear item, is that they can still fix the problem and ship them out.  It's not a core component that cannot be replaced, nor is it a component that you shouldn't expect to have to replace.  There's also plenty of third party ones if the stock ones just aren't cutting it for you.  And let's not forget Bambu ""the best printer manufacturer to date"" can't even ship working replacement nozzles at all with a 80% failure rate... So much so people recommend just getting the 3rd party ones as they're more reliable... So it's not like they're the only company that have had issues, but their issues HAVE been addressed even if not completely solved for some.  

The actual piezo itself I have not heard really any problems with, it's all been about the offsets in the gcode and the bed temp problem.  I personally haven't had any problems with bedscraping, but I do plan to get some PPS-CF filament to try and will want to confirm this.  Also, as far as I'm aware, if you're not using Qidislicer you shouldn't have had the gcode issue in the first place.

FDWXnWQdgzM,Ugw9XgTZJRNOR09GeEB4AaABAg,,@SebasTian-od7oz,"You should not have disposed of the ""faulty"" cable. 
You could have stripped it to confirm the following suspicion and maybe show us an educational video as a result: 
⚠There is a chance that this was one of the increasing numbers of cases where the manufacturer did not embed the ground (protective earth - PE) wire to save money. ⚠
If I were you I'd check all my IEC connector cables for a missing ground connection, especially on devices in the style of laptop power supply bricks and anything with a plastic shell. 
Since devices with a non-conductive casing theoretically do not need a ground connection to be safe against giving you a shock when you touch the casing, manufacturers would get away with silently removing the ground wire in cables provided with such devices. 
What they do not take into consideration (or do not care about) is that somebody could swap their incomplete cable onto a metal encased device, which could be what happened in your case.

Also like others already noted: Even with the ground wire removed, the case should not be live. 
I'm a bit surprised that your appliance leakage current interrupter (ALCI or RCCB) does not trigger with the ground connection re-established. 
The voltage potential on the casing should create a current leakage in the PE wire and trigger your leakage current breaker (if the current would reach life-endangering levels). Maybe yours is faulty?
It wouldn't hurt to go to the switch box in your home and press the ""manual trigger"" test-button on your leakage current breaker (which you should do once every 6 months anyway). 
Just don't forget to switch off your PC and tell everybody in the household before, since this kills the power ;)",1,2025-03-19T20:51:15Z

I am not sure that you should have received a shock from the case, even with the noted issues on the socket and lead used. Surely the case still should not have done this.

I am yet to choose my very first 3d printer and your observations about the lack of a chamber heater also had concerned me when I had seen screenshots of this one online. Whilst I appreciate there is a cost factor, a chamber heater would only seem to compliment the potential that this would otherwise have.

I am pleased that you noted the filtration, being aware of the ideal being both HEPA certified and active carbon. Even printing PLA is not free from micro plastics concerns and whilst filtration can help, it has to be of the appropriate type to be meaningful.

Points taken regarding the choice of a closed type of firmware. I have begun to appreciate, having joined several discord channels for various 3d printer manufacturers etc, what it can mean to have a Klipper based firmware and Fluidd. Even though that might not seem so relevant for me at this point it is still a big put off for me to consider this one.

This next bit is only based on what I have picked up so far......

If I want to have the 3d printer lottery Gods on my side, first time buyer, and enjoy the best OOB experience with minimal fuss, then a Bambu type seems to be  a good choice.
At this point I would have no real desire, nor skill, to wish to tinker to keep the printer running, and Bambu Labs seems to as close to that as I have seen so far, apart from their locked firmware........

Sorry, you seem like a good, decent reviewer but I am getting tired of the ""I did not get paid"" cop out like that makes everything perfectly OK. No money changed hands, but you got two free printers (I assumed) ahead of an official launch and time to make a review which means we are now watching your content and helping you get paid by YT. 

I do know this is not free money and that you did put the work in, but the mechanism is real. Without being on the nice list of the companies you don't get early access and you don't get the clicks, right?
Also, one thing a lot of ""independent"" reviewers do is to not review products that they can't do a mostly positive review on - hence, skewing the overall picture the consumers get to see. 
On a related note, there's a reason why proper journalists aren't allowed to receive gifts of any kind or even a paid meal by an interviewee because we know staying fully independent is an illusion as soon as you do. Or at the very least, you open yourself up to people not trusting the reporting. 

I don't know where you fall on this spectrum, but to just state you don't take money doesn't mean you aren't making money from the affiliation. Also, I guess nice of you to give cudos to your contact at Elegoo who took care of you during her/his holidays. On the other hand, perhaps they wouldn't do that to a non-youtuber? Either way, I personally found it a tad worrying. They have a huge interest in making you happy ahead of their big launch, that's likely why they did it. While that person might be a nice person, you just gave the impression that this is a standup company that will pull out all the stops to help the customers. Would a good journalist have thanked a company CEO for ""taking time out of their busy schedule"" to talk to the publication about the great new product they are launching?

For years I have longed for one of you to take your reviews in a different direction - be the one that B U Y S the printers with patreon donations or your YT payment (many of them are getting so cheap it should be doable) and yes, your review will be a few weeks late, but you will be the one we will all actually trust 100%.

Discontinuity in the PE or not, the device MUST NOT have any live voltage at the case. I suspect, that in fashion similar to QIDI Q1 Pro, the heater is not controlled by double pole relay - the provided cable might have reversed L and N and does not bring L to the case, but N...  Very dangerous design. 

Secondly, I am worried that the RCD did not trip when you were shocked, started doing the voltage tests or finally when used the PE continuous cable. Yes, the currents weren't that high, but that's exactly what the RCD are designed for - to trip when there is any leakage, often to the annoyance of the users.

Same. All those modders are mostly hobbyists. I spend all my time in cad and other software modeling, i start up the printer to prototype parts, i dont want to change anything, i want it to print, print fast and to keep dimensional accuracy.

Thats why i got a bambu, despite my serious dislike of the company and its policies they make printers that work.

FDWXnWQdgzM,UgwXUUxuI4R3gKCNn2x4AaABAg,,@JeffreyHawkins,"You have actually found a very big electrical issue. It sounds like Neutral and Ground are reversed or connected at some point in the printer. Under proper operation, voltage comes in on the Line/Hot wire. Work is done as the current flows through the electronics to the Neutral (NOT ground) wire. All other conductive parts are linked and connected to ground as a safety net, in case something hot inadvertently touches a conductive non-electronic part like the frame. Ground will never have voltage unless something extremely serious is wrong.

So, what you discovered was two safety issues... Something hot is in fact touching or connected to the frame when it shouldn't be. And your ground circuit was in a state of failure, preventing it from acting as the safety net it is intended to be.

If two printers in a row had this same issue, there has likely been a manufacturing run (where two wires were reversed. Or someone on the line is putting them together wrong.

But i have given it to a friend of mine as an xmas pressy. His ender 3 s1 was giving him many issues and we both tryed sorting it and i just keep going to him, but bambu it just kinda works. i know people hate to hear that but sorry it just does. 2619hrs and counting and only 3 issues, and only one was a stopper. Anyways the video here let me see what i missed out on for the unboxing as my mate lives a few hundred miles away. I wanted to deliver it to him myself but life got in the way so had it delivered to his place. Anyways thanks again for the video and enjoy the printing mate.",1,2024-12-24T22:08:27Z

bOC-IIgP4JI,UgxzA_zL0zoIzpa1EId4AaABAg,,@nickk6518,"Against my better judgement, I invested in this same 40W model which was delivered the first week of August (2025) and I think this is the first video so far that doesn't just show you how to put the thing together and then tell you how easy it all is. Like you, I had major trouble getting my 2017 MacBook Pro to recognise the machine. Despite the fact that it uses USB-C it seems that connecting to a MacBook which also has USB-C ports doesn't work if you use a USB-C to USB-C cable. As with other things the documentation it doesn't address this possibly Mac-specific issue.  Also, the documentation on the micro-SD card is rather Mac-unfriendly. In the folder '5. Software Operation Manual"" the Lightburn User Manual refers to settings that may be different in the Mac version of the software and (unless I am mistaken) where it tells you to select the COM port to connect the device, on Macs the drop-down does not display, for example, COM3, so it can be a bit tricky to figure out the correct port to use. I'm actually thiking about re-writing that documentation to be Mac-specific so that other people don't get flustered when thigs don't seem to work.

One thing that I did notice is that it is actually possible to swap the two side panels over so that the fan and port are on the right side not the left. It does mean you need to flip the fan round, but that's easy, and it does also mean that the power cable is not long enough to reach the socket on the inside front-left of the unit. I am going to contact Creality and suggest that they include in the box an extensions cable but I bought some 24AWG silicone-sleeved wire which I am going to splice into the existing fan cable with some cable management on the inside back of the case and hope the fan still works!

The other thing you mentioned was the height of the unit off a level surface. I bought a 'bundle' offer from Creality from their eBay shop and it came with a large honeycomb bed, a Rotary Tool Pro and a set of four risers which you just screw in where the existing feet are. Alternatively, you could just use four baked bean cans, I guess!!",0,2025-08-11T13:52:01Z

All 3D printers can be fire hazards, as stated in every manual: do not leave the printer unattended. I am confident Qidi will address any issues that arise. If a fire occurs, it’s important to remember that this risk is universal to all printers, not just Qidi's. It's unfortunate to wait for replacement parts, but Qidi’s commitment to fixing issues is commendable. In contrast, I’ve struggled with Glowforge for two weeks to get a schematic for a known circuit board issue. Glowforge is a company to avoid. Qidi’s openness speaks volumes about their dedication to customers. Speaking to the Qidi CEO is possible; try reaching Creality's ANYONE with printer problems—

The real safety hazard in any printer is the hot end. By monitoring the printer as instructed, you’ll catch issues before they escalate. Qidi printers are no riskier than other models. I have the original X-Plus, and it excels in printing various materials. Whenever I have questions, Qidi’s support is prompt and helpful. MANY companies sell 3D printers, but VERY FEW offer such great customer support. If anyone has a $700 xplus 4 they want to trade for a $7,000 Glowforge pro once its fixed, id do it in a second.

Qidi have shown themselves to be a responsible organisation with high levels of innovation and customer service. They distinguish themselves by listening to their customers and creating an open dialogue with them. Facets not always shown by other suppliers of similar equipment. I have no doubts that they will respond, but in common with most other makers and other ‘improvers’ who seek to modify equipment, we absorb a certain amount of risk as soon as we open a machine,let alone change it. My son is a qualified electrician, it is in any individuals gift to ask a qualified person to inspect their work or improvements prior to use, as I do. Please give them the time to carry out a full fault diagnosis before issuing a complete corrective statement, in addition to their initial response. I have no affiliations with Qidi but I have been involved in manufacturers responses to very much larger product faults, and the worst thing that any user can do is ‘stoke the fire’ with irresponsible rhetoric, some of which has led to the demise of some excellent UK and overseas companies, diminishing choice, value and overall quality of product.",0,2024-11-27T19:45:58Z

Prints flawless abs prints up to 305mm, it has seen hundreds of hrs of run time since receipt on 25 September. Just about all prints were high temp heated chamber with many hrs of engineering grade filaments run with ease in it.   Make sure you know on new board the wiring on right side changes from original, watch their whole video beginning to end before changing or putting in new board.  Use flashlight to find how left side of casing releases from inside, took about 2 minutes but found spot that allows it to release..... WIll add a second plus4 in future and just saw they doing BF sale til early Dec, the Q1 Pro which I also own has price that is very hard not to push buy button, tempting great sale price for Q1 Pro which has amassed hundreds of hours of non stop abs at my shop.  I will do huge shoutout to QIDI support they are fantastic and they go above and beyond.  I own three of their printers and the support rocks!  The heated chamber issue only on 115v systems does not effect UK.  New board and updated firmware takes care of any and all concerns.   They took care of issue and added one yr extended warranty, outstanding.  Glad did not have to ship back or wait long time for new printer.   QIDI has excellent support staff and come a long ways over the past few years.   Like other companies like Bambu, recalls or issues happen with pace they release these machines, like Bambu they learn and adapt and instantly resolved issues and all future production will see updates.

To be fair the printing quality was good, but the issues started to creep up very quickly, when first the back cover of the print head got repeatedly violently torn off during the rapid front-right corner bump motion, then a bigger issue popped up whereby if the print job got paused for any reason, the resumption of the printing would start off at a shifted XY position ruining whatever has been printed before. Then the nozzle would start coming out of the pre-print purging/cleaning procedure with blobs of material stuck on it, ruining the ensuing print. The firmware update did not resolve the XY shift of print resumption, but instead just killed the machine entirely, with the table being forcibly jammed right against the ceiling limit and the print head would then lodge right into the print bed, at which point the machine was basically done. Qidi, while replying fairly quickly to their credit, tried to wiggle themselves out of acknowledging the entire host of issues by referring to this cluster**** as a singular ""anomaly"" and gratuitously providing me with some google link for my further education. Not until I firmly insisted on returning the unit (which luckily crapped out literally one day before their 30 day stated warranty was running out) only then reluctantly they promised to send me the shipping label next week which is yet to be seen.

However, these issues show that Qidi may not have tested the printer's safety enough. Of course edge cases should be tested: different voltage levels, operating in too hot environment etc. I'd say thermal issues are the biggest safety concern for any 3D printer manufacturer, and even a cheap FLIR camera attached to a phone would've presented this problem with an obvious white dot that represents an out-of-spec temperature. Now,, the issue is remedied with people being asked if they want to work on mains voltage, as well as a firmware upgrade to limit power.

7pGYxgZ7rLA,UgxHXzZyNZGO1EGH2xh4AaABAg,,@DaltoeMusic,"Thanks for the thorough investigation!! I'm on 240v, so hopefully my heater board is safe. However, after 1.5 weeks of low-moderate use (with low-moderate speeds), some other issues have started appearing on my production unit. The machine has developed a mild, but noticeable scratching/grinding sound whenever the tool head moves along x-y rails. It is hard to tell if the noise is coming from the the belt rollers, rail/shaft bearings or stepper motors. It actually feels a bit rough or gritty when I manually slide and reposition the tool head. The original grease on the lead screws has already started turning from a white color to grey, which I hope isn't being caused by premature wear on the metal contact surfaces. I guess there is a chance that could be from printing black filament (if some strings or particles found their way onto the tracks). The final issue could be more cause for concern... I think it was @noizieworks that pointed out that some of the cables coming from under the heater in the build plate tend to rub on the side of the chamber. Today I noticed another small, insulated cable plugged into a connector on the back edge of the bed, and this cable is rubbing on the black plastic below the air filter. Within two weeks of operation I can see signs of frictional wear on the cables plastic insulation sleeve - which I think is concerning and, with everything else combined, I am starting to think this might be a recall or warranty replacement. I would like to know if these issues are confined to my machine, or whether there is a bigger QC problem underlying all of this.",0,2024-11-11T09:02:47Z

What you need to understand is that at the time this video was released the thumbnail was different. The right hand panel showed a shot of someone from behind on his laptop in a video conference with an asian gentlemen whose face was obscured. This, combined with the title, implied that the author had a VIDEO conversation/response from the CEO. The 15/20 seconds spent reading a response from Qidi is the exact same reply I, as a Plus 4 owner in a 110v region,  received from Qidi. While he absolutely probably received that e-mail from the CEO, seeing as he does not live in an affected region, it certainly wasn't any new information nor was it a video as the labeling of the video implied. SO, yes I stand by my click bate comment. Both the thumbnail and the title convey the content of what you're about to watch and drive interest in viewing a video. Not only drive you to watch to video but to watch it all the way through which is important for YouTube metrics as it applies to creator compensation.

7pGYxgZ7rLA,Ugy4xaCxUQLoPCUOhPd4AaABAg,,@MichaelJHathaway,"The problem is that the Qidi design didn't anticipate their printers being used with 120 volts, like that we use in the United States. It is not the coil that is the issue, but the large yellow box on the pcboard. Watts are equal to the volts multiplied the current. Therefor the problem is that 220volts X 1.82ampre = 400 watts, but 120volts X 3.33ampre = 400 watts. So at the lower USA voltage, the current increases and the original relay was not designed to handle the higher current. In my opinion, you should change it out regardless, but I think it will be ok if you just add a larger fan to the electronics chamber if you are at 220v. Changing the relay out to a heat sinkable Solid State Relay is safer, it has a cooling surface to dissipate heat and the switch is transistorized instead of a mechanical coil and arm. Do Not Use SSR's made in China! Taiwan, Japan, USA are good. The current firmware drops the output to the chamber heater down to 150 watts. After you have replaced your SSR, you will need to increase the wattage. I would keep the control setting close to 90C since the chamber heater housing is made out of ABS plastic.

Grant tested yesterday on a live-stream what appears to be an alpha version of the final fix board, and found it to solve the issues of overheating components on the chamber heater power supply board for 110-120VAC regions.

I am a huge fan of this printer, the quality it produces is awesome. I am also a believer that Qidi actually cares about customers, but rushed this launch and still needs experience dealing with this kind of problem. The Qidi owner community is great though.

7pGYxgZ7rLA,Ugzf_roreOM5H-7aFRh4AaABAg,,@JasonBurchell76,"Sorry, gotta put my 2 cents in…

While waiting for the new board to arrive, consider moving the current board with the issue to the exterior of the machine, or, if feasible, leave it in place but rig up some temporary mounting. Adding a heatsink with a fan to the choke (inductor) could help manage heat more effectively in the meantime.

I agree that manufacturers should take all necessary steps to identify and resolve these issues, working out multiple solutions and implementing a fix as soon as possible. However, at this level of 3D printing, users of advanced equipment like this should also be capable of safely troubleshooting and applying quick fixes, allowing continued use of the new machine without significant downtime.

That said, if we’re calling this a “community,” then let’s extend that spirit to support the vendors who bring us the latest tech. Working together to overcome issues like this can strengthen the whole ecosystem.

Thanks, and let’s keep pushing the hobby forward.

flxKcV3ZeEs,UgwpnktVArPLsr6Y3LV4AaABAg,,@YahWho-is1tt,"Hello Rick-I
and thanks for sharing this good stuff!  Just came across this new one and - although this isn't really the most appropriate (best practices sort of thing) place to post such a question, maybe somebody will take one look and offer up what might to them be OBVIOUS???  If it's not YOU - well, I'll certainly understand!  But I have DEFINITELY found your videos to be sane and informative in the past, so - here goes:
I did the klipper upgrade to my old ender 3 some time back, and although it is actually up and running, there is a substantial problem that I've tolerated until now. But it's HIGH TIME I got it resolved, as it came up again this morning!  You see, since I did the upgrade, based upon a new main board plus a Pi clone I am unable to print anything in stand-alone mode!  All the gcode files of things I have uploaded (in most cases printed from mainsail on my desktop PC) are shown in the ""SDCARD"" menu choice, but no amount of pressing the thumbwheel switch will allow me to select said file and actually print it!  Other things work - like setting temps on bed or hotend, but not the fundamental function of printing from the card!  Lame, indeed!  
So my little query here amounts to: where would you think the problem might lie: the firmware on the mainboard or the OS on the rPi board?  I'm at a loss to guess - so in such cases I usually flip a coin (pocket binary decision utility).  Maybe I should check for updates for both.  
Usually it's not a problem to just kick it off from the old PC, but when I want another copy of a previous print, it seems like a minor nuisance to have to use the sledge hammer when it should have been feasible with the stapler on the desk.
Still really liking Klipper, though - guessing you agree!

Their documentation is lacking and there is no record of being able to set Bed PID Calibration, Extruder PID Calibration, or Shaper Calibration. Without those details, a lot of damage can be done if someone attempts to use their firmware package. I brought these up as legitimate questions in their Discord and was told to read documentation. Not good enough when a dev says ""I don't have to tune it."" Not everyone's environment is the same and this is just short-sidedness on their part.

NONE of these have ANYTHING to do with the printer firmware.  If t he bed is well leveled MECHANICALLY then the effective parallelism between the print head and the bed matters, which the printer firmware DOES control.  SO, in most cases, the first level being put down well doesn't really work better on Klipper or Marlin, though it may be easier to configure the printer with Klipper to get a good first layer.  After that, the odds of a first layer failure are probably about the same for either.  At least that's been my experience.",0,2024-11-14T13:04:33Z

h7OaJNlri14,Ugx3FvpYn3deIf7f_lh4AaABAg,,@BobSimpkin,Just finished watching your series on Klipper and would like to say thank you. I'd heard about it but didn't really understand where it fits in to my 3d printing world. Your videos have demystified the whole subject and I'm in. Can't seem to find any config files for my printers yet but I'm looking forward to the challenge of creating or adapting some. Thanks again. Bob,2,2024-11-17T03:06:55Z

I've followed your tutorial to the letter which is great, however, after installing klipper screen and copying the additional moonraker file for update manager im unable to restart mainsail. I've tried several new installation's to no avail. i get this ""Cannot connect to Moonraker (192.168.4.50)"". ~/printer_data/logs/moonraker.log.",1,2025-04-07T08:28:23Z

Soon I realized that my wlan0 was not connected to the wifi network. It is very likely possible that you might have installed network manager, which I did, along with the klipperscreen interface software and it is messing with your wlan0.  To address this, I manually accessed the terminal on the pi (ctrl+alt+F1) and added the ssid and password (Code - nmcli device; nmcli device wifi connect ""your_SSID"" password ""your_password"" ). Some instructions have been provided in the Klipperscreen website under network section of troubleshooting. Chatgpt also provided a step-by-step instructions on resolving the issue. You will need to use usb keyboard and maybe a hdmi connection to external monitor to do this. This has let me remotely access moonraker/mainsail from your computer to follow along the next steps from Ricky's video.",0,2025-07-09T16:14:48Z
