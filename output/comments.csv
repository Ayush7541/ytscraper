As other have said if it really was about security, local authentication using industry standards would have been far superior than trying to develop a whole new cloud system that now involved user name and password being sent across the internet and stored in databases in the cloud waiting to be compromised.",0,2026-01-30T04:36:02Z

YiMevD99WKE,Ugxw_dteRawyBjFxS_54AaABAg,,@ttabbal,"At the end of the day, it comes down to this. If I don't control it (root) I don't OWN it. It's not mine and can be modified or taken away at any time by the manufacturer. This is an intolerable situation when I still am expected to pay full price. 

If they want to provide me with the hardware and I only pay for filament, maybe. But probably not. Frankly, if Bambu decides to shut down or similar, you own a paperweight. And outside of replacing the control board, nothing you can do about it. This is why my X1C has X1Plus installed, and is completely blocked from the internet. And I can still monitor it, and my other printers, thanks to Octoanywhere. 

My other issue with this, is that they modified the device AFTER THE SALE. I bought it knowing I could use various tools. They forced those tools to break. They can call it security, but there are other ways to secure things. Again, unreasonable. If they wanted to do it for new machines only, and were very clear about the change, fine. But that's not what happened.

I think you are legit trying to be objective. This has a LOT of backstory that you aren't going to get from Bambu. As for BTT, they could be letting potential customers know about the issues a bit more clearly. But it's also not unreasonable for them to be irritated at Bambu.

As a result, I don't recommend Bambu to people anymore. I used to suggest them to people all the time. It sucks, but I won't put my reputation on the line for backstabbers.

As a programmer who has custom built printers and modified the software. There are better ways to handle security that would work and still allow users to use their printers. This, like most so-called safety restrictions are not about safety. They are about control.",6,2026-01-30T00:23:13Z

YiMevD99WKE,UgyHTv3teiv101LdgmF4AaABAg,,@joshhardin666,"BTT should certainly be transparent regarding on what firmware their devices function and in what modes.  From what I understand all of BTT's products that have been developed for bambu lab printers still function correctly on the latest firmware in developer mode.  Personally I own a p1s, and I run it in lan mode with developer mode enabled.  I keep my printer on my iot vlan and block external network access to all of my printers (the rest of the printers that I have run klipper (voron v2, voron v0, creality k1 max)) just like I do for the rest of the IOT devices that run on my network (because I don't trust anything these days to not phone home, and it limits remote attack surface). while still allowing me to do anything that a printer is capable of just by using an authorized computer on my network.  if someone wanted to access my printers and iot devices they would either have to gain access via the administrative vpn that I run (which would require my username, password, AND a key file (so reasonably unlikely) or they would have to be inside my house using one of the computers that i've authorized to talk to said devices OR i suppose they could manage to get on my user lan and then either hack my network switch or my firewall to allow access (pretty unlikely... i'm not that sweet of a target).  so even if I were to buy a network enabled laser machine (I honesly just might at some point), I trust that if I configured it that same as my printers network-wise that I'm pretty safe regarding the network security aspects.  but it should NOT be up to my device manufacturers to tell me that I can't use a device that I purchased and own with other equipment or software in any manner that I like.  THAT'S the part that I find obscene.  equipment that I own should be made to work in any manner that I see fit that is technically doable.  my klipper machines do exactly what they're told when they're told, my marlin machines (when I ran them) used to do the same (with a little help from some raspberry pis for wifi and frontend administration in that case), my bambu labs printer needs to do what I want when I want, and when it doesn't, I'll resell it and buy something new and tell everybody exactly why I did so.  it's NOT an exploit to use undocumented APIs to gather data end control a product if that's the owner's intent.  that's not a bug, that's a feature, and removing features (even untentional ones) because bambu simply doesn't want users to be able to inexpensively expand capabilities and undercut bambu's more expensive models doesn't mean that they should be able to get away with locking down their ecosystem.  at this point I don't care how well they work, I am *MUCH* happier with my creality k1 max than my p1s because of the direction bambu is going with their firmware. - with the k1 max, I can go right on the front panel and if I want (and only if I want) enable the root account of the computer that drives the thing and do literally anything that I want with the printer's underlying operating system... creality CLEARLY will not warrant any changes I choose to make, but they'll still honor the warranty of the hardware (assuming I didn't cause physical damage through modifying the software or hardware) and they'll still support me (so long as I didn't create the problem at hand via my modifications).  it enabled me to use shaketune (which is advanced belt tensioning and resonance compensation), KAMP so I can choose to do finer meshing in just the print area and have more control over purging as well, I can add various hardware and other software components, directly live stream from the printer if I want to, added a bunch of macros for various bits of calibration, etc.  does anyone have to do these things to enjoy their k1 max? no.  does is significantly add value to that machine for me and other hobbiests? absolutely!

right now I'm mostly happy with my p1s in lan only + developer mode. it does mostly what I tell it to do. if they choose to remove or cripple that functionality, that'll be the day that I no longer own a bambu machine.  Prusa is a bit more open, but still pretty expensive for what you get... the core one is a nice printer but I can't stand factory unenclosed printers, and the enclosure design for the prusa xl is pretty terrible overall.  these closed printers are trouble though (bambu, elegoo centauri carbon, etc.)...

Now, I just want a printer that works.  Since I got my H2D in December, I've done lots of printing, and only one was less than perfect.  That one turned out to be a problem with the model and the designer's profile, not the printer.

I bought the printer in full knowledge that it is a closed-source printer.  I would prefer open-source, but not one other commodity item in my house is open source.  My central heating, my microwave, my coffee maker, washing machine, TV, none of my music hardware like keyboards, effects pedals, electronic drums, none of my workshop tools, or my car, nothing.  Why do we demand our printers and only our printers are open source?  It's because until Bambu Labs came along, they weren't good enough.  We needed to mod them endlessly to get them to perform well.  Bambu Labs made the first printers that were good enough out of the box to get great prints.

My only reservation is that, if a time comes when Bambu decide it's not economical to continue to support the product, that they should then open source the product.  I've spent a lot on this printer, I don't want to be left with a brick, or have to downgrade it in order to continue using it.  If by such a time they still have IP worth protecting, then they can open source most of the product, but continue to support the library containing their secret sauce.  Open source code can call the API for the library without knowing what magic it's doing.  If Bambu don't do this, and I am left with a useless printer, I will never buy from Bambu again, and I dare say most others would say the same, so it's in their own commercial interest to look after their customers.",1,2026-01-29T19:52:32Z

YiMevD99WKE,UgyWj8Wzls_XRnyvCxh4AaABAg,,@liftbikerun,"In the industry, having a closed source proprietary product is generally frowned upon.  Specifically an industry of ""makers"".  Honestly, I feel like either I'm missing the underlying jab at BL or you're missing the point of why people had and still have such an issue with BL.  There's zero reason not to open up an API to things HomeAssistant etc as countless companies have done so.  It all comes down to $, you harp about BTT being focused on ignoring warnings and only caring about BTT, but I'd argue Bambu had plenty of warning to provide an API for people who want that option and THEY are the ones only caring about money.  I'm sure in their mind the Touch was infringing on the P2S that was coming later down the road (with the touch screen) or they felt it would cost them sales of the X1C and people would choose the P1S + Touch.

I've never understood why consumers (you yourself is a consumer as well) defend companies over your own best interests.  Your best interest is to have as open a platform as possible to be able to repair and replace items as needed, third party options for when support runs out, and options if improvements can be made.  Kinda reminds me of the current political environment where low to middle class earners are arguing against tax increases for the rich.

2nd what was the CVE Bambu Lab sited as the vulnerability they had to patch, was this vulnerability actually a remote code execution, remote privilege exploit, or was this an exploit that would require access to the local network and or physical access to the printer?  If it was a real security threat Bambu Lab should have no issue providing these details since it has been patched and a firmware released.

3rd based solely upon the responses you provided it seems the only security issue was to the security of their what can only be assumed as a paid licensing for API access and seeing that their really isn’t any officially supported third party hardware or software for Bambu Lab printers this licensing either doesn’t exist or is so prohibitively expensive that no company could ever make a profit producing hardware or software for Bambu Lab printers.

As of now based on this video it does appear that what Bambu Lab is protecting isn’t the security of the end user but the security of their $$$ bottom line as Bambu Lab could have easily would with these popular 3rd parties to make their devices work with out requiring exploits, Bambu Lab even admits that Bambu Lab had a year to work with BTT on the issues and knowing how popular a lot of these 3rd products are I’m really leaning to Bambu Lab either not wanting to because they want to lock people into just their offerings or the licensing cost or terms were so bad no one would ever agree to them.",0,2026-01-28T17:29:16Z

For most users the issue wasn't as much BTT than Orca Slicer, and if the issue is with laser controls then why couldn't they have ""locked"" these commands only?
""Developer mode"" (as it requires LAN-only) blocks one of the main reasons to buy a BL device, that is to say being able to visually check the status of the print through the Handy app on a smartphone, so it's not a perfect option.

This is an excuse to raise the walled garden higher and freeze out third-party products that provide functionality that Bambu refuses to provide. I really dislike how you're spreading their corporate propaganda as if they have good intentions -- they do not. This is a move to purely benefit Bambu and not anyone else. Especially not the users.

""Turn on a laser to burn down your home""  and ""Put lives at risk"" -- nice way to spread panic and hyperbole. Prove it. Prove that a third-party product will enable this. I'm waiting. Just like I'm waiting for evidence that cell phones cause covid and that aliens are stealing cows. Pure conspiracy to manipulate your opinion.

You keep saying that third-party developers were selling products with bad intentions. Well, it is my opinion that Bambu created this walled garden with bad intentions. They are just as guilty and yes, they gas lighted everyone, promising that they weren't going to shut out the functionality that everyone wants and Bambu does not provide. They are still gas lighting everyone by saying that it's just about security and it's for the user and that developer mode is just as dandy as peach pie. Lies. 

LAN/developer mode is NOT a viable solution. It's extremely clunky and requires the user to use work arounds for the functionality that isn't disabled.

YiMevD99WKE,UgzG0QRggVwRz_nLByN4AaABAg,,@QrchackOfficial,"This is prime BS and safetywashing. Their own ""enhanced security"" was done by embedding a password into their software, which got extracted hours after release with zero issues. If random people can do it in hours, nefarious actors do as well. The VAST majority of Bambu customers have their A1/P1/X1 and will not own a H2 series in the forseeable future, potentially/likely ever. Developer mode is not the answer, because Bambu willingly chose to, for no security-related reason, cut you off their Bambu Handy app, the second you enable Developer mode. They also updated their ToS to include that future firmware updates ""may block new print jobs"". They asked Wayback Machine to stop archiving their privacy policy page, which obviously raises some eyebrows. It's not as simple as ""just use old firmware bro"", with updating the firmware to the botched new version being a requirement to use AMS 2 or HT with P1/X1 printers.

The only risk profile that exists is if all of these are true:
- you happen to have a publicly routable IPv4 address (which is increasingly rare for consumer internet connections, most being locked behind CGNAT, and the option to have one is a paid extra, increasingly only available to business customers)
- you happen to have went into your router settings and disabled all firewall/security options or forward Bambu-specific ports so that your printer is exposed directly to the internet
- someone also happens to have your code that's displayed on the printer's screen for LAN mode
- or, Bambu has such garbage security in their printers' firmware that it's possible to brute force the connection PIN by trying all number combinations possible, and is trying to sweep this under the rug, diverting attention from their blatant incompetence and fixing the issue in a roundabout way, removing existing functionality they had in the sales pitch and you paid for.

And then, the most someone can do, is heat up your room by turning on the heatbed. And maybe increase your power bill a bit until you notice your room got hot.

You're trying to come across as just a customer who happened to get a printer for free from the lovely people as Bambu, but it's failing hard. Real hard.",0,2026-01-28T12:48:27Z

ZvrMXkUR-ys,UgwVNS6_Lpd4JOTb8tF4AaABAg,,@notyouraveragegoldenpotato,"Ive had the Plus 4 since the 1st week it went on sale. It is EPIC. Hands down one of the single highest spec'd printers ANYWHERE near (or far) from the price range. I planned on grabbing a q1pro but never got around to it. Looking at the q2 pro- its literally just a slightly smaller plus 4- with a couple improved parts to make it even better. Epic printers. I will stand by the statement that NO ONE makes a printer even close in the price range. Print Tolerances are literally engineering/machinist tight when youre properly tuned. Epic. And qidi has been EPIC. Also- I had one of the first 100 qidi boxes released before they went on sale. Not gonna lie I had a horrific experience with it. It was straight up beta coded i swear and needed work still. I was so frustrated after weeks of fighting it i straight up took it off and set it back in its box. I just barely pulled it back out and reinstalled it and they seemed to have gotten it locked down tight now and it works flawlessly- if not a little bit noisily just the same as all multi boxes seem to be. I use my plus 4 for high spec engineering filaments 90% of the time. EVERYTHING. Ive even run one of the PEEKS mostly succesfully just for shits and giggles. If you want to run engineering filaments- im not talking abs cf and similar crap- i mean ppa- cf, pps, PET, PURE PC-cf not the mixed low temp stuff the real deal ultra strong high temp expensive stuff- the qidi plus 4/q2pro are EPICA",5,2025-11-08T04:12:50Z

It was the internal design and the tension of the spring. A simple solution would’ve been to install what my tpu mod kit does. Which is lessen the tension on the spring and install a screw to adjust tension. Because not all filaments require the same tension. They have it cranked all the way down for hard filaments. Which is why when you print tpu you get jams or can’t do it at all. Even Bambu has a way to loosen the spring tension. So does prusa and a lot of other brands.,1,2025-09-15T13:29:36Z

I didn't want to wait for Micro Center to receive H2Ss, so I purchased the Creality.  I've had issues with X-1 Carbon AMS, so I replaced it; otherwise, it's a fabulous machine.  The H2D is amazing. The only thing I don't like is the H2D's second head.  It might be reasonable to some, but it's a pain for me. This will be the third time I've torn the Creality apart since I purchased it 4 weeks ago.  The first time, as I was disassembling the extruder, the little spring popped away, never to be seen again. I spent $32 on a new spring.  If the extruder clogs, the filament strips at the extruder gears, and you tear the whole thing apart.  I didn't purchase the Creality to be a mechanic.   I'm sorry, but the Creality is poorly designed. The whole extruder should come off straight up with one or two bolts.  Then, when the extruder is on the worktable, you should be able to disassemble the extruder without pulling 4 small wires before you can take the thing apart.  All 4 of those wires should all be in one master plug on the extruder assembly for easy removal.  There are ten small bolts sitting on the build plate.  Really?  I will suffer through until I solve all the Creality problems.  In the meantime, I'll wait for Micro Center to start shipping H2Ss.

This is not necessarily an issue if the company helps you to try and fix it, however there a lot of people on Creality forums and Reddit with the same issues as me and not receiving solutions.

Instead of trying to fix problems they just keep releasing new products.

For instance, they have the exact same issue on the K2 Pro extruded with TPU, where are the developments and fixes????

Personally this has left a bad taste in my mouth.
