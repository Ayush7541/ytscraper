TO_COKkK6Pw,en,"The problem with lukewarm Christianity is that you blend [music] in with everyone and you impact no one. And also another problem with lukewarm Christianity is that you can follow [music] Christ enough to be called a disciple but then still betray Jesus. And that's what [music] Judas did. He followed Jesus enough to be counted as one of the 12, but then when [music] the time came to it, when his life was on the line, when he was desperate, where his commitment [music] was there, his choice, he betrayed Jesus. And that's what happens with lukewarm Christianity is that you end up betraying Jesus. You don't have [music] time to be a lukewarm Christian. And ultimately, God doesn't have time for you to be a lukewarm Christian. You know, people's lives mistake because of the way that [music] we live because you may be literally the only Bible that someone reads. Hear that? You literally may be the only Bible that someone reads. Hey guys, I truly believe that God is speaking to you right now and he wants you to hear this. Today as I was reading the Bible, this particular verse stuck out to me. And it's not the first time that I read it, but it's something that just hit me a little differently, if that makes sense. And that was in Revelations chapter 3 where God was talking to the church of Leodysia. And he was talking about how I don't want you to be lukewarm. You're neither hot nor cold. And he's like, I just wish that you would choose one or the other. And as I began to think about that, I did some research just to get a better understanding of what that particular Bible verse was saying. And in case you didn't know that the church of Philadelphia, that city had an aqueduct that was six miles long and it was taking in water from a hot spring. So whenever it reached the city, it was lukewarm and people just got used to it. And I think that as believers, if we're not careful, the more we are hanging hanging around with the world or hanging out with believers who are not pursuing their purpose and really living the life that God has called them to, we can we can become comfortable. And because of that, we become ineffective for the kingdom of God. And I believe that Jesus wants us to make a difference in this world around us. He doesn't want us just to have the label Christian and really not make an impact. Instead, he wants us to live the Christian life so that we can actually make a difference. And I just began to think about how many of us, including myself, a little bit in 2025, we wasted time because we wasn't pursuing our purpose or we lived in compromise and we wasn't fully dedicated and being in alignment with what God has for us. And it just got me thinking that guys, God doesn't want you to waste your 2026 like you did in 2025. He doesn't want you to be the Christian that has the label Christian, but your life doesn't reflect Christ. Come on. You know what I'm talking about, right? You have Christian all over your Instagram bio. You you you you call yourself a believer. You go to church, but then on Saturdays and Friday nights, you're not really living for the Lord. Or even in the things that you're watching or even listening to, you know, it's not good for your soul, but you're still listening to it. And I believe that God is really trying to help the church, help the believers to really draw a separation because honestly guys, the time for middle Christianity being in the middle ground, those days are over. And to be honest, that should have never been a time, but it has been a time. And really, I believe God is really trying to extract and draw out people and believers who are truly committed to following the Lord. Because Jesus even said it that if you are a lukewarm person, you are worthless to me. I'm going to spit you out my mouth. And that's what's happening to some of us because we are not committed to God. Because we are not desperately dedicating our life to God. We're worthless to God. We can't even make an impact. We can't even make a difference in the world around us. And maybe that could be the reason why some of our family members are not saved still or even some of our friends or even our co-workers. Maybe that could be one of the reasons why we actually don't see transformation in our life is because we're not fully de dedicated and submitted to God. And because of that, God is just going to spit us out. You know what's so interesting? When Jesus said, ""I I I wish you was just hot or cold."" It made me think about being allin, right? Jesus is looking for committed followers of Christ. He's looking for people who are truly seeking after him and not just playing the middle ground or just happy that they're on the team and they got the jersey, but they really don't want to get in. They don't really want to get on the field and play. And guys, Jesus will spit you out his mouth. The person that is lukewarm, you see, I I would say this, the problem with lukewarm Christianity is that is that you blend in with everyone and you impact no one. Think about that for a moment. Lukewarm Christianity, you blend in with everyone, but you impact no one. That means your life looks the same as everyone else. Your speech looks the same. Your lifestyle, your your dress, the way you carry yourself, the way you even treat other people. It looks like the world around you, but you impact no one. You're not being a light. You look just like the darkness. And also, another problem with lukewarm Christianity is that you can follow Christ enough to be called a disciple, but then still betray Jesus. And that's what Judas did. He followed Jesus enough to be counted as one of the 12. But then when the time came to it, when his life was on the line, when he was desperate, where his commitment was there, his choice, he betrayed Jesus. And that's what happens with lukewarm Christianity is that you end up betraying Jesus. Even though you follow Jesus, you end up betraying Jesus in your commitments, your values, your theology, your your beliefs, your ideology, and all these different things. how you raise your family, the the type of people that you vote for in office, the the ways that you conduct your business, the way that you treat other people, your friendships, all these different things, your personal life. Lukewarm Christianity will eventually cause you to betray Jesus. And Jesus doesn't want that. Jesus wants you to be fully committed. That's why in Joshua 24:15, Joshua looks at the people and says, ""Look, you can follow the people across the Euphrates River. You can follow these guides. you can follow these people, but he said, ""As for me in my house, I will serve the Lord. As for me in my house, I will follow God in."" And guys, as believers, some of you haven't made a commitment yet on who you're going to follow. You want to follow Jesus because you like what he gives, but then you still tampering around and playing with the world. You still want to drink a little bit. You still want to get drunk. You still want to smoke weed. You still want to watch seductive movies. You still want to uh read books that that spur the desire of lust in your life. You think it's all okay, but what you really don't know is that because you became comfortable with it, you don't realize that is toxic to your life. See, the issue with lukewarm Christianity as well is that you can get so used to toxicity that you are unfamiliar with what health looks like. And guys, God doesn't want that for you in 2026. He wants you to be a man and a woman that's fully passionate, that's fully surrendered, and that's fully committed to him. He doesn't want you to pursue the other things. He doesn't want you to be like Lot's wife who was running away from danger. But because she loved the cities of of Sodom and Gomorrah so much, she turned and she she looked back at the city and became a pillar of salt. Guys, God doesn't want you to look back anymore. He wants you to let go. That's why he says just uh the person who follows me and puts the hand to the plow and then looks back is is unfit for my kingdom. God doesn't want people who's constantly looking back and looking at what they missed out. Instead, God wants you to focus on the things that you can get for him from him because you are pursuing his his purpose that he has for you, you are pursuing the kingdom. And guys, I just believe that if you really want to make an impact in the world around you, if you really want to make a difference in this world that Jesus Christ has for you, guys, you got to be committed. You got to be fully surrendered and committed to God. Because even in Titus 1:16, man, guys, this verse always hits at home and and and to be honest, it always checks me. It says this, ""People claim that they know God, but by the way that they live, they deny him. And because of that, they are detestable and they are disobedient and worthless for doing anything good."" hear that people claim that they know God, but by the way that they live, they deny Jesus. And because of that, they are detestable and disobedient before God and they are worthless to him. Guys, that's the Bible. That's strong. That's not Renee Mallet. That is the Bible. That's what Jesus is saying is that you have to ensure that you're not just a person that has the label of Christianity, but your life actually reflects Christ. Does your lifestyle, does your deeds, does your thoughts, does your actions, does the way you treat people? Because Jesus also said this when they asked him, ""What is the greatest commandment?"" And he said, ""Love the Lord your God with all your heart, mind, soul, and strength. And then love your neighbor as yourself."" He says, ""This sums up the law and all the ten commandments."" Says, ""Loving God with everything and then love your neighbor as yourself."" You got to love your neighbor. You got to love people. You got to love God ultimately because the way that you love God reflects how you're going to love people. And the way that you love people is a reflection on how you love yourself and also God. And guys, I just believe that God is stirring up the church. He is stirring up the believers say, ""Look, there's no time for lukewarm Christianity anymore. There's no more time to be on the sidelines and not on the field playing it. there. There's no more time just to say you have the Christian jersey on just so that you can be part of the team, but you don't want to contribute to the team. And Jesus is saying if you want to be that, if you want to be that type of follower, if you want to be a fan of Christ, but not a follower, then I'm going to spit you out my mouth. See, what I noticed whenever I played football is that the players who played and who who got reps and everything was the ones that were good, right? It was the ones that were really good. But this is what I've noticed through the the training and offseason is that you had a lot of people that wanted the jersey of the football team, but they didn't really want the commitment. They they always looked nice. They always had their bands, the sleeves, and all the gloves. They always looked pretty, right? They always looked pretty cuz they were part of the team, but they never really played. And it was because some of them just wanted the jersey so much that they didn't really care if they played or not. They were just happy that they rep the jersey. And Jesus doesn't want that. He doesn't just want you to rep the jersey of Christ. He wants you to be on the field playing the plays that he's given you, the assignments that he's called you to so that you can go out and really make a difference. And guys, I just want to say that God does not want lukewarm Christianity. You have to choose today whom you're going to serve. Is it going to be God? Are you going to follow Christ? Are you going to follow culture? Are you going to follow your carnal nature and your flesh? But guys, that that day of Christianity, that time is over. God doesn't want you to do that anymore. That day of Christianity is over because your family is counting on it. Your children, your businesses, the industry that you're in, the schools that you're in, the people around you don't have time for you to be a lukewarm Christian. And ultimately, God doesn't have time for you to be a lukewarm Christian. You know, people's lives are at stake because of the way that we live. Because you may be literally the only Bible that someone reads. Hear that? You literally may be the only Bible that someone reads. And if you're not living out the life how God has for you, man, you're giving them a false narrative of the gospel. And God doesn't want that. So, look, I just want to pray for you. If you just feel like this really touched home for you and you really want to submit and you just want to get back in alignment with Christ so that you can be fully dedicated to him, then I want to pray this prayer for you so that you can start off 2026 on the right foot. You can start off strong so that you can also end well. So let me pray for you real quick. All right. Lord, I thank you for my friend right now that's watching this video. And I just pray that as they are just [music] seeking your face. I pray that my friend would just repent from all of their sins right now. [music] Repent from being lukewarm and instead, God, that they would choose [music] to be fully dedicated to you. I pray that you forgive my friend right now. And Lord, as they are surrendering their mind and their heart back to you to get in alignment to you, [music] that you're just flooding their heart and their mind with peace and that they would just feel that you are closer than a [music] brother. God, you're closer than anyone else, God, because your word says that you're [music] standing at the door and knock. And God, you're knocking right now. And I pray that they will let you in. I pray for my friends right now [music] that they will just start off strong, God, and that they will end well and be the light and salt of the earth, God. That they won't compromise. instead that they will [music] emit your rays, God. They will be your lighthouse, God. And when people [music] look at them, they know, man, that man and that woman is a Christ follower in Jesus name. [music] Amen. Well, guys, hope this video really blessed you. Um, thank you so [music] much for tuning in and I just pray that, man, why don't you just encourage somebody with this video as well? If you're not a subscriber, man, [music] please consider subscribing because, man, I would love for you to be a part of the family here so that we can continue to grow [music] together. But ultimately, man, I love y'all. Thank y'all so much for tuning in and y'all have a great day. Peace.",success,1,2026-02-06T16:51:37.375096+00:00
hb9G_3dqr9I,en,"What's holding most men back isn't their circumstances, their age, or a lack of opportunity. It's actually their identity. Their identity being rooted in fear, insecurity, confusion, and hesitation. And these are not personality traits. They're actually symptoms of identity, not rooted in Jesus Christ. You see, the Bible says that God did not give us a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and a sound mind. So if fear is leading your decisions, it didn't come from God. And when a man doesn't know who he is, he begins second-guessing himself. He begins acting in delayed obedience. And he is waiting for confidence before taking action. And that's how potential and purpose stays locked up for years. But when identity is rebuilt, the mind is transformed. Everything begins to shift. Confidence follows, clarity follows, and even courage. You don't overcome internal battles by trying harder. You overcome them by standing on who you are in God. You were created on purpose, for a purpose, and with the purpose. An identity will always precede action.",success,1,2026-02-06T16:51:40.744773+00:00
6NPZ9oRrofc,en,"Most men are not being held back by their circumstances. Instead, they are being held back by the internal battles that no one else can see, such as fear, insecurity, doubt, overthinking, and just confusion about who they are and what they're called to do. And the dangerous part is this is that you can look fine on the outside, but quietly lose the battle on the inside. And today I want to take a moment and share why these internal battles exist and how scripture shows us as men the way out. Because freedom doesn't start with changing your environment. It begins by rebuilding your identity and reshaping your thinking. You see, most men think that the problem is really this. a lack of opportunity, a lack of money, maybe even a lack of clarity, or maybe a lack of direction and all these different things. But the Bible really shows us something deeper and different than what the world likes to communicate. See, the real internal battles are this: fear of failure, fear of people, insecurity, comparison, shame, and just confusion about who you are. You can have the talent and still be paralyzed. You can have opportunity and still hesitate. And you can even have the calling and still shrink back in fear because you don't know who you're called to be. Why is that? Because identity precedes action. And if your identity is shaky, your decisions will be shaky as well. I believe Paul tells Timothy something that every man should hear. In 2 Timothy chapter 1 verse 7, it says this, ""For God has not given us a spirit of fear and timidity, but of power, love, and self-discipline."" Let's break this down real quick. Fear is not from God. Insecurity is not from God. And chronic confusion is not from God. That means if fear is dominating your decisions and your thought life, it didn't come from heaven. You see, fear attacks your confidence. It attacks your obedience. It attacks your identity. It attacks your courage and your leadership and just who you are as a man. And here's the truth. Most men don't even realize they're battling fear. Fear doesn't usually tell you to stop. It tells you to delay. It tells you, ""Wait a little longer. Get more ready. Make sure everything is perfect. Don't move yet. And what if I fail?"" That's how men stay stuck for years. And I'm sure you've met men like that who said they're going to accomplish or pursue this vision or pursue this woman or build this, but then two years later, three years later, or even six months later, they're still in the same exact spot as they were before. Why is that? Is because fear kills more dreams than failure. And insecurity is an identity issue, not a personality issue, to be honest. And a lot of men like to say this type of stuff. I'm not an insecure person. No, insecurity is not your personality. It's a symptom of misplaced identity. It's a symptom of not knowing who you are in Christ. Because when you don't know who you are, you look to others for validation. You start comparing your life to other people. You start secondguessing your decisions and you let fear drive your decisions. You let fear make you avoid responsibility because insecurity thrives where identity is unclear. And Satan doesn't need to destroy a man. He just needs to keep him unsure of who he is. Because if a man is unsure of who he is, he is unsure on how he is supposed to be on what he is supposed to do and how he's supposed to change the world around him. Because your true identity is actually defined by God. Because here's what the Bible says in Ephesians chapter 2 verse 10. It says this, ""For we are God's masterpiece. He has created us a new in Christ Jesus so we can do the good things he had planned for us long ago. I love that verse. God has planned amazing things long ago for us to accomplish. And here's what this Bible verse says. It gives us three clear things that we should look at. First, it says we are God's workmanship. That means we are not an accident. We are not a mistake. And you are not random. You were actually intentionally formed by God, by the creator to do good things. Number two, it says that you were created with a purpose. Your life has an assignment attached to it. And then here's the third thing I want you to catch. That God already prepared good works for you to do. You're not trying to invent your purpose. You're not trying to invent your calling. Instead, you're trying to discover what God has already planned for you to do. When identity is restored, direction begins to follow. That's amazing because the internal battles is the thing that's keeping you stuck. And honestly, here's how we actually conquer the internal battles that we're facing. Let me break this down practically to give you step by step so that you can ensure that you're walking with success. Step one, identify the lies that you're believing. Ask yourself this one thing. What am I afraid of? What am I afraid to do? Why do I keep telling myself this? Why am I keep telling myself that I'm not going to do that yet or that hey, not yet. This is not the right time. Also, where did this belief come from? Because most internal battles are fueled by lies we never challenge with the word of God. Number two, replace the lies with godly truth because truth will always dismantle fear. When scripture becomes your reference point, your mind begins to stabilize. That's where clarity begins. That's where vision begins. That's where the dreams begin. And you know what? That's where clarity about who you are begins. You don't fight lies with your willpower or just saying, ""I'm going to stop thinking about this."" No, you fight the lies by replacing it with biblical truth. Then the third thing is this. Are you ready for this one? Act from identity, not from your emotions. Because confidence isn't a feeling. It's actually a decision that you decide to make. Men grow when they act from who they are from God and who God says they are, not how they feel in the moment. A man who acts on their feelings is not a mature man at all. Because the saying that says decisions lead and feelings follow is so true. Instead, a lot of men let their feelings lead and then they let their decisions follow. Instead, be the man that decides that you're going to be this person. Decide that you're going to take action. Decide that you're going to pursue this transformation. decide that you're going to be the man that God has called you to be because all action is rooted in identity and that weakens fear and insecurity over time. And here's the other thing I want you to catch real quick, right? Is that transformation is actually a process is not a moment. And see, yes, when you become a follower of Christ, things begin to break. Your flesh begins to die and you get a new identity in Christ. Yes, those things happen in a moment, but your sanctification on who you're supposed to be and the person that God has called you to be takes time to build out. And you see, the internal battles don't just disappear overnight. Think about it like this. Let's say you just began following the Lord 10 years ago, and now you're 30. You have 20 years of junk, 20 years of the world's influence on your life. So, a course is going to take time for God to pull up all these weeds. A course is going to take time for God to reconstruct your life, to restructure your mind, to restructure your heart and your vision and who you are. So don't get upset that you're not far enough down the road as you thought you were. Instead, look to Christ. Look to him for your direction. Look for him to your scorecard. Let him be the compass on where you should go. Because if not, you're going to let your comparison, you're going to let everything else of what the world is telling you should be instead of who God has called you to be. And every time you choose truth over fear, truth over insecurity, or obedience over comfort, and decisions over feeling, and identity over your false insecurity, you grow stronger because men don't become confident overnight. They become confident by consistently acting from the identity that God has given them. They become courageous overnight from the identity that God is telling them who they are in this word. That's why guys, you can't let the world around you stop you from getting in the word. You have to let the word of God filter everything that you do. Your identity has to come from this word. And guys, truthfully, one of the reasons why you probably still have some immature things in your life, immature emotions and mindset, it's because you're not letting the word of God mature you. you're not applying the word of God and you're not surrounding yourself with other godly men who are pursuing the purpose that God has for them. So, here's my encouragement for you as we begin to close. If you've been battling fear, insecurity, or confusion, you're not weak. You're not broken. And you're not behind in life. You're just in the middle of your transformation. You're right in the middle of where you were and where you want to go. You're just right there. And I want you to know that God wants to rebuild your identity. He wants to renew your mind. He wants you to stand on truth. And he wants you to pursue the purpose that God has for you because those internal battles will no longer control you whenever you begin to submit yourself to God. Whenever you get to surrender yourself to God and say, ""God, here I am. I want to be the man that you have called me to be."" If this message spoke to you, if this message challenged you, I want you to go in the comment section and type in the word identity because I want to pray for you and I want to see how God is moving in your life. And also, if this video encouraged you and helped you take that next step, consider subscribing or even sharing this video with other people because on Basic Bible, I'm committed to building men with purpose and impact. So guys, see y'all next time. I love y'all. Peace.",success,1,2026-02-06T16:51:44.025378+00:00
GmcHfaQ_C7s,en,"If you want to hear God's voice more clearly, listen to this. Most men are not struggling to hear from God. They're actually struggling to silence all the other voices that are not from him, such as fear, doubt, overthinking, pressure, people pleasing, and other people's opinions. And when everything else is loud, clarity disappears. Here's what scripture shows us. That God's voice doesn't compete with other noise. It actually leads us into stillness. That's why Jesus said, ""My sheep hear my voice."" That means hearing God is normal for believers. Confusion and lack of clarity is not. The real issue isn't that God stops speaking. It's that your minds have been crowded with noise. It's been crowded with the world static instead of tuning your ears to what God says. That's why the Bible says that we're transformed by the renewing of our mind. Because if your mind isn't aligned, even when God speaks, you won't be able to recognize it. Let me say this more clearly. If your Bible is closed, clarity will not be there. God is not hiding direction from you. He's actually inviting you back into alignment. So, silence the noise, create the space, and return to scripture and prayer. And also obey the last thing God already told you to do because clarity doesn't come from overthinking. It comes from aligning your life and your mind with God's",success,1,2026-02-06T16:51:52.616765+00:00
