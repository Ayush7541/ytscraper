MQ2Cb2a8hJQ,en,"running into problems like this, they get old really fast when you're 3D printing, especially when you're new. Because let's face it, in slicers, there are a ton of settings and some of which I still to this day don't know exactly what they do. So, I created a software, it's called Slicer Ninja, and it's launching on Kickstarter here pretty soon. And it basically allows anyone to 3D print without even knowing a single thing about the slicer. You can simply upload your STL file, give it to Slicer Ninja, it'll optimize it, give it back to you with all the settings set, all your supports, everything is done for you. Even if you're not a beginner like myself, it'll save you a ton of time. But the only way it's ever going to make it is with the community support, and that's you. Now, Slicer Ninja is fully functioning. It just needs some finishing touches from actual developers. My plan is to bring in a dev team to finish out Slicer Ninja and make it the best software possible. With your help, I think we can do it. No problem. If you want to get a really good deal on Slicer Ninja and stay in touch with what's going on with it, check out the link in the description. I'll pin it in the comments so you won't miss a",success,1,2026-02-08T21:26:01.488917+00:00
YiMevD99WKE,en,"So, let's stop right there. We all know who they're talking about. What? So, you knew about this over a year? You were selling paper weights? Premium paper weights is what you were doing. Not cool. As a business owner, I would never do that. So, in this video, we'll cover some of the questions that I asked Bamboo and the answers that I got. Like, why'd you change your terms of service? Did you try to hide it? And if I don't update to the latest firmware, will I lose warranty or will I lose warranty if I stay on developer mode or LAN mode? There was a ton of questions that were floating around the internet. A lot of them just left everybody confused, not knowing what to believe, including me. And come to find out, some of the stuff that I believe it was actually not even true. So, I'm going to cover several different topics around this whole controversy of firmware, the ecosystem, locking out third-party softwares, and oh, speaking of thirdparty software, there's another company in this whole thing that deserves your attention way more than Bamboo Lab does. I can't wait to tell you about that. So, real quick, let me tell you about today's sponsor, and it's me. Stay Ready to 3D Print has come out with Morphex TPU. We launched it a couple of weeks ago, and the sales have been absolutely nuts. Everybody loves this stuff. It's a super easy to print TPU. So, it makes printing shoes like these a breeze. And they're super comfortable, too. I was so tired of dealing with TPUs and being forced to print with a super stiff 95A TPU just to get the 3D printer to print the TPU. And what's the point in printing a shoe in 95A? It'll be so stiff that you won't even be able to wear it comfortably. But with Morphex, all those problems are over. It's the best of both worlds. It starts out as a 90A, so it's easy to print, and then after it's heated and extruded, it morphs into a 70A, so it's super soft. I mean, you can take this whole shoe right here that's done in 15% infill and you can bend it everywhere. It's soft. I wore these exact shoes to BitSummit 2025 and let me tell you, they were great. So, if you want to get Morphex TPU, go to stay readyto3dprint.com and check it out. And I'll leave a promo code in the description to give you 20% off. So, go check them out because that code will only be good for a limited time. So, real quick, let's go back a little bit so I can explain how we got here today. So, some of you might remember I went to Rapid TCT up in Detroit a few months ago. I built Creality's 11th anniversary motorcycle. I took it up to Detroit and I actually went around all of Rapid TCT and I interviewed several different brands, Bamboo being one of them. And while I was at their booth, I was asking about their new H2D machine. And one of the Bamboo reps, he was just going on and on and explaining all about the H2D machine. And then towards the end of the interview, he brought up software. And so I thought it was a great opportunity to actually ask some follow-up questions and that is when this happened. >> So speaking of developer mode, I think some people were worried about with Huh. >> Do you chat with >> I'm sorry. >> Are you asking about authorization stuff? >> The the land mode >> land developer mode. >> The developer mode. Yeah. Huntington has also. >> Now, keep in mind, this happened right in the middle of that whole controversy thing, right after they had announced the terms of service changes and all that good stuff. So, this didn't look good at all. And to me, it looked like, what are you hiding, right? Why would you abruptly stop an interview like that and do it so rudely? That was the main problem that I had with the whole thing. It wasn't that you didn't want us to talk about software, cuz I get it. you want to do that in a controlled way, especially with all the controversy bouncing around. So, I understood that. But for me, it was just the way that they went about doing it. It rubbed me the wrong way, especially when I was there to talk about their H2D machine and I was promoting it on my channel for free. >> Oh, okay. Okay. We'll cut that out. Don't worry about it. >> Yeah. >> So, I know in the video I said, ""Okay, don't worry. I won't post it."" But honestly, when I got back home, I thought long and hard and I had decided, you know what? No, I need to post this and let people make their own decision. I didn't try to influence anybody's decision in that video. I simply posted it and just gave the facts. Now, if you look at some of the comments, people got pretty heated about that whole thing, and that video got over 10,000 views in the first few hours. But if you look at it as a whole, like I do, when I look at my analytics, it was over 75% likes and only like 25% dislikes. So, the video resonated with most people. So, about a week after the video had been out on YouTube, I got an email and it was Bamboo actually replying to an email that I sent them asking to review a machine. And needless to say, they were a bit confused. They were wondering, ""Hey, we see you want to review one of our machines, but we're a little confused cuz now we see this video."" I'm glad that they did because if they wouldn't have reached out, this video never would have happened and I would never have been able to bring you guys the actual truth. And I think that's what everybody needs. And honestly, it's kind of sad because a lot of those people made decisions just like I did based on rumors that mostly weren't true. And a lot of those rumors, they were just simply misconstrued and baseless. So, after a few emails back and forth with the Bamboo Lab rep, we came to an agreement. He sent out an X1C and he gave me a $400 Bamboo Lab gift card where I could go on their store and buy pretty much everything I needed to basically test out their printer over the next couple of months. And that's exactly what I did. So, needless to say, me and Bamboo Lab started off on a really good foot considering the video I had just posted. I was a little confused at this point and I was definitely on my guard because I was like, ""Wait a minute. I just posted this video basically bashing you and you reply to an email and at first you're confused and at the end of a couple of emails now you're sending me a $1,000 printer and giving me a $400 gift card. So I was wondering, okay, wait a minute. Are they trying to buy my opinion or like what's going on here? And I've had the printer several months now and I've been using it pretty much almost every day. I just got busy and I couldn't just jump on the video right away. But honestly, it's been a good thing because it's allowed me to use the printer over a long period of time and really get to know the Bamboo ecosystem and test out all the stuff that everyone's saying to see for myself, is it true? And then the things that I wasn't sure about, I reached out to Bamboo Lab directly with a whole laundry list of questions and they answered them. All right, so I'm not even going to pretend like I memorized this whole email because I didn't. So, I got my phone here. I'm going to go over with you the questions that I presented to Bamboo and then as you'll see on the screen here, my questions will be in white and their answers will be in red. So, the first question I asked was what support and warranty coverage do you get if you're using the cloud on the latest firmware, if you're in LAN mode with no internet, if you're in developer mode, or even if you're on an older firmware. And here's what they said. Support and warranty are provided for all publicly released models and firmware. Naturally, if a user requests support for a bug or feature that has already been fixed, the only recommendation support can provide is to update to the version where that fix was implemented. So, that was their answer on that. Pretty much you've got support and you've got warranty. So, the second question was about terms of service and updates. So, my question was, if a user declines an update, can functionality, support, or warranty be reduced or blocked under the current terms of service? and they basically said please read above basically refer me to the answer for the first question. So in other words no you won't be blocked and it won't be reduced you will have warranty and they will provide support. So number three is authorization control and thirdparty tools and this is where it gets interesting. This next question is Bigtree Tech/Panda Touch support. And my question was, Bigtree Tech has publicly stated that some of their devices, including Panda Touch, will lose functionality after recent Bamboo updates. What is Bamboo's position on this? And is there a plan to maintain compatibility or provide an alternative? Here's the answer they gave. Once again, this is old news. They had over a year's notice. In fact, their release of Touch was one of the triggers for us to be transparent about closing these exploits. We don't want people purchasing something without knowing it won't work in the future. Outside of developer mode, we will not allow this functionality as it involves an unauthorized device. And again, the reason why Bamboo is doing this is to protect you. And Big Tree Tech is only concerned about selling you a third party device. That's the only reason they care if Bamboo patches some of these security exploits. And Bamboo has pretty much said that if it means compromising security that they're going to patch it and they're not really worried about what Big Tree Tech thinks about it. They let them know about this a long time ago and they chose to continually sell these third-party devices. Blows my mind. My question was, will Bamboo provide an official pathway API program for thirdparty controllers like Home Assistant or Panda Touch to retain full functionality? And if so, what is the plan or timeline? And here's what they said. API access will only be allowed through authorized license partners. Now, for the community, the available option is developer mode. As mentioned in my previous emails, we gave more than a year and a half of advanced warning about this change. In Panda Touch's case, we cannot take responsibility if a manufacturer chose to rely on a known exploit and still decided to sell hardware that was bound to stop functioning at some point. So, let's stop right there. I want you to think about this. Who are they talking about? We all know who they're talking about. They're talking about Big Tree Tech who makes all the panda stuff. And here's where a lot of this controversy came into play. Because guess who played dumb? Whenever this whole controversy came about, Big Tree Tech, they acted surprised. Oh, I can't believe this. Oh, this doesn't work now. What? So, you knew about this over a year? You knew Bamboo was going to push out an update that basically rendered your product useless and you continued to sell those products to the public? I don't understand that. Now, I could get if you announced like, ""Hey, these products might be coming useless. Here's what we're going to do with products that we already have manufactured in stock. We're going to go ahead and reduce the price down to basically build price and push them out at super low prices just to get rid of them and stop manufacturing them."" But that's not what they did. They continued to build these products for Bamboo Lab machines knowing that at some point a firmware update was coming out that would render their products useless. So, like I said earlier, I think there's a company here that deserves our attention way more than Bamboo Lab does at this point. Yeah, it just blew my mind when I heard that. Now, you might be thinking like, ""Oh man, Bamboo Lab is throwing Big Tree under the bus."" But really, they're not. Bamboo Lab is covering theirelves at this point. and really big tree tech threw them under the bus. By continually selling these products, you set users expectations that they'll be able to use these products. So, of course, these users got mad when Bamboo Lab did this that everybody looked at Bamboo Lab like, ""Hey, what's going on here?"" Right? when in all actuality, Big Tree Tech should have put out something along with Bamboo Lab when they found that out, letting people know, hey, you might not want to buy these devices because they probably won't work here in the next 6 months to a year. So, Big Tree Tech, if you're watching, I think you owe everybody an apology for one, acting surprised when you already knew what the game was, and for two, for continuing to sell a product that you knew was going to be useless. you were selling paper weights. Premium paper weights is what you were doing. So yeah, to me not cool as a business owner I would never do that. So for my question number four is about LAN only mode. Now my question was will LAN via Bamboo connect always work without internet or an account? Which features differ from cloud mode and is any telemetry collected in LAN mode? And the answer was yes. On current hardware, there will be no changes to how things work. As always, I can't speak to future hardware or software. Those remain unknowns, which is, and that's fair. Developer mode. Now, here's one that I heard all the time from various different people. And honestly, somewhere along the line, I adopted it and I actually believed it, too. So trust me, if you got caught up in this whole controversy, you're not alone because there's a lot of stuff that I believed and now looking back, I didn't even do my homework and I just adopted certain things. And I don't typically do that. I'm a very, very curious and investigated person, but I heard it from a reliable source, so I didn't even think about it. So, on to developer mode. I asked, ""Does enabling developer mode affect support or warranty by itself or only if issues are directly caused by changes made while using that mode?"" And the answer was, as stated above, running this mode does not void warranty or support. They're basically saying that you can use developer mode and you're not going to lose support or warranty, as a lot of people believe before, including myself. So, question number six I asked was about firmware roll back. And the question I asked was, will Bamboo provide a supported roll back option to older firmware that keeps first-party apps functional for users who need compatibility? So basically, will they offer a firmware roll back that allows you to continue using those big tree tech products? And the answer was yes, unless stated otherwise in release notes. So that's kind of left open. It it's like yeah, unless we decide not to. So, that one, I mean, I wouldn't bank on it. I really wouldn't bank on it. Cuz let me tell you this, a lot of the reason why Bamboo Lab did the whole terms of service thing boils down to their new machine. And here's why. They released the H2D. And in the H2D, there's a laser inside that machine. And what the bamboo rep had explained to me during an email was that we're basically putting a laser inside people's living rooms, inside their bedrooms, inside their garages, and we have to do everything that we can to protect those people and not allow some person with ill intentions to hack into their system using an exploit that, let's say, Big Tree Tech used in order for that Panda Touch to work. Someone else can use that same exploit to get into your machine and do nefarious things such as turning on your laser in the middle of the night or while you're away on vacation or get access to your camera and be able to, you know, look around or whatever. But the biggest thing was was safety. You don't want someone to be able to get into your machine and turn on that laser in the middle of the night and burn down your whole dang house. And honestly, big props to Bamboo Labs for not caving in to those companies, those third party companies that, you know, out of selfish reasons, they wanted those accesses to be left open. They wanted those exploits to not be patched. That way, they could continue selling you their little third-party products. And Bamboo Lab decided to choose their customer and their customer safety over all of those companies. And that's kind of how this whole thing started. So, I just want to give props to Bamboo Lab for that. And I see why they did it now and honestly it was the right move 100%. So we're going to move on to question number seven and that is future gating of core functions. So my question here was can you confirm that core printer operation start stop jogging temps job uploads etc will not be gated behind proprietary authorization except where necessary for documented security reasons. And that kind of plays to what I just said. Can you confirm that you're going to allow us basically allow us freedom unless security reasons require you to shut it down basically is what I was asking and he said nothing will change with current hardware but to be clear the only mode that currently allows this is developer mode and that's something we already knew and that's great. So in developer mode you have a lot more freedom. All right now moving on to number nine public documentation. So my question on this was, ""Can you point me to the official pages covering terms of service, authorization, control, land mode, developer mode, and warranty so I can cite them directly in my video?"" Their answer was, ""Once again, since all of these modes are supported, I can only refer you to our terms of service."" And then he gave me the link. And so I'll include that link in the description for you guys to go check out for yourself. Okay. Now, next, it's kind of a paragraph, so bear with me. I asked the Bamboo rep. I said, ""Hey, I'm not sure if you've seen Lewis Rossman's video about this a few months back."" I'm asking some of the questions he brought up as well, but one thing I'd like to know is, did Bamboo delete the web archives of the terms of service changes made? If so, why? Why not just tell everyone they made changes versus trying to hide it? Was it just to avoid confusion? I'm curious because if that truly happened, then it just seems odd without a logical explanation. and his answer was, ""Please refer back to my original email."" And then he reiterated, ""The only change was a minor clarification regarding forced updates. We would only ever apply or force an update if a public safety issue arose from a firmware version. That's the simple fact. Despite how some may want to portray it otherwise, we openly reported this change, but after being accused of gaslighting, we chose not to make further comment. In my opinion, that was probably not the greatest choice, but hey, that's a choice that Bamboo Lab made, and honestly, I think they'll be okay. So, my response was, ""Well, I'm sure you have some very logical explanations for a lot of this, and I look forward to hearing them."" And he went on to say that we had hoped that clear-minded users would understand why these changes became necessary once we began integrating features like a laser into the printer. Unauthorized 3D print commands are one thing, but triggering a laser unattended could put lives at risk. So, like I had explained earlier, Bamboo instituted a lot of these changes due to the fact that they're putting a laser in people's living room. So, just let that sink in and maybe some of this will make sense now because before to me, yeah, I was with you guys. A lot of it didn't make sense. And I'm an avid Creity user up until recently. Of course, I will be selling off all my Create machines and changing brands. I don't know if that's going to be Bamboo or Prussa, but it will be one of the two. And that has nothing to do with this video. It just happens to be that I'm no longer promoting Create as a brand. So, he goes on to say, ""As a company, we have a responsibility to protect not only the best interest of our customer, but also the best interest of the company itself."" With that said, most if not all of the accusations made back in January have proven untrue. We were not hiding anything. We were simply closing a known protocol exploit. Even then, we provided our user base with options and continue to support developer mode. At this point, it's baseless for anyone to continue pushing this narrative. So, yeah, there you have it. A lot of the hard questions were asked and every single time they came back with a solid answer. Now, I didn't take these as just straight up fact. When I got the machine, I've tested the machine over a period of several months. Now, let me give you my thoughts on the machine, right? I've always thought that Bamboo Lab had a great product from day one. I just never used a machine for the simple fact that previously I enjoyed modding my machines and to a degree that you just couldn't do it on a bamboo machine. And now a few years down the road, I'm just not at that point anymore where I want to do mods like that. Honestly, now I just want to be able to print with a printer that works 9 out of 10. And yeah, I like to add the occasional light kit, the occasional flowtech hotend, uh different extruder gears, minor stuff like that, but I'm not doing those in-depth mods that I was doing before. I'm just not doing them anymore. And that was one of the biggest things holding me back from using bamboo. And of course, now that they've clarified this, it really has put my mind at ease. And I feel 100% okay going out and just buying bamboo machines if that's the brand that I decide to go with. I'm not sure yet. It might be Prussa or who knows, it might be another brand, but those are the two brands that are, you know, number one and number two. I'm just not sure which one it'll be just yet. But I can tell you with the X1C, my experience with the X1C, it was basically just like any other printer that I've had. I always put all these printers basically in the same category pretty much. Nine out of 10 printers, they just work and they all have little minor issues. Like my X1C, it's been phenomenal until recently whenever the extruder stopped working and it just kept jamming after jam after jam. I didn't know what was wrong with it. I reached out to the rep like, ""Hey,"" he was on vacation, but like he went and made sure the next day I had an extruder in the mail and I got the extruder. it solved the problem. I don't know what happened and maybe it's something I did. I'm not sure. But honestly, I mean, I don't get upset at those things because those are simple 3D printing issues that from time to time, you're going to have them even with the best machine. And I think the sooner people realize that and stop putting certain brands on these pedestals that they really don't belong. I mean, after all, these are robots. They only do what you tell them to do. And very very rarely do they just up and do something on their own that they weren't told to do. So n out of 10 if your machine is messing up or it's printing bad. It's usually something you're doing and that's just the raw truth. It's usually usually something you're doing you're doing. But overall the X1C has been a good machine and honestly the print quality is actually phenomenal. And I really love the way that you can basically just use your Bamboo Handy app and you don't even have to connect to a PC. That's been my biggest thing with the X1C is it's kind of how I use the X1C. Now, I have a bunch of other printers, but the X1C, it's kind of like my running gun machine. I'll be on Bamboo Handy and I find something that I want to print real quick. I'll just pull it up, hit start print, and and there it goes. So, I leave that machine on pretty much 24/7 and I'll just shut off the lights from my phone or whatever the case may be. So, that's one of the biggest things that I like about the Bamboo whole ecosystem thing is the way they require people to upload their files basically in a 3MF format to where someone's already printed that file. It's ready to go. All I have to do is hit print and make sure that I have that filament in my printer. And honestly, you don't even have to make sure you have that filament in your printer. You can select, let's say it's a PLA model and you all you have is PET G in your printer. You can actually select Pet G and it'll actually print it in Pet G for you. All the settings are already pre-done. You don't have to do anything. And as far as print profiles, oh, I haven't done any of that with the Bamboo machine. It's been great. And really, Bamboo has really been innovating here lately. So, obviously, they're coming out with the H2S, which has already hit, and then they're coming out with the H2C. And from what I understand, it's going to be six tool head changer. And that thing is going to be absolutely phenomenal. I mean, wireless induction hotends, it's got some high-tech stuff in there, and it's going to change the way we do color printing. And the future is tool changers. So, if you're thinking about buying a machine, you need to consider, if you want to do multicolor, you need to highly consider getting a tool changer. Whether it's the Bamboo H2D with the upgrade or the Bamboo H2C or even the Snapmaker U1. There's several brands coming out with multi-tool head machines. I even heard that Creity is finally thinking about doing one after I decide to get rid of all my Creity machines. Now, I'll make a video on that later on why I'm leaving Creity and I'm no longer promoting their brand. They didn't treat us very nicely and they allowed some stuff to happen that I'm just not okay with as a human being and I have to do what's best for the channel. And at the same time, they weren't innovating like other brands were. Other brands were coming out with tool changers and all this new stuff. And it seemed to me that Creality was basically just slapping another letter on on a printer and saying, ""Oh, here's our new printer."" Like the K1 Max and then they released the K2 and then the K2 Plus and then the K2 Pro and the K2. And honestly, the only thing different in the whole K2 lineup is size. They didn't change much of anything. If anything, they just took away features and put out another printer. And so that is part of the reason why I left Creity was lack of innovation. Well, now they're coming out with the multi-tool head supposedly. I guess we'll see. But one thing in this game, I'm always open ears to anything new. If it's a new brand or a new product, I'm not married to anybody. And I go where the innovation is and where we're being treated fairly. One thing I can say about the Bamboo community is that their users are dieh hard. Because when I made that rapid TCT video, man, were they in the comments. They were in the comments bashing me and talking all kinds of smack and saying that I was a Creity fanboy and all this stuff. Well, what do you have to say now? I own a bamboo machine and I'm even considering bringing bamboo products throughout my whole studio. They're in my top two as two brands that I'm considering of bringing into my studio. So, now I know what they'll say. They'll probably say, ""Oh, you're just riding on bamboo or whatever the case may be."" So, I know what to do with all that. I just don't listen to it. I know at the end of the day, I just want a solid brand in my studio and Bamboo is a solid brand and I really respect what they've done with the terms of service, how they handled it, how they answered all these questions and it just really opened up my eyes about them and so yeah, I really appreciate that. Thank you, Bamboo. And with that, until next time, stay ready to 3D",success,1,2026-02-08T21:26:02.158893+00:00
OReSdBUIe3A,en,"Well, this is going to blow your mind. And honestly, I can't believe this is where we're at in life. But check this out. >> I'm proposing the first in the nation law requiring all 3D printers sold in the state of New York to include software that blocks the printer from creating a gun. It's just common sense. Just common sense. >> Common sense. It's funny they mentioned that. So, if you're using common sense, common sense would say to go after the real guns that's had millions of cases in the past 5 years versus 3D printed weapons that's had in the hundreds in the past 5 years. I mean, come on. Do you really think that criminals are going to buy a 3D printer, sitting down, taking the time to learn the software, figure out how to 3D print, how to get a print to come out good, and do all of that to get a 3D printed weapon when they could just go on the street and buy a weapon on the black market or steal one or do whatever they do to get unregistered firearms or illegal weapons, whatever it is. So, this stuff about 3D printed weapons and all that, they're they're going after this. To me, that is not common sense. To me, there there's an underlying agenda here, and I'm pretty sure you guys can see through it. So, what do you think about this?

5ipo5Vlc7tU,en,"Here's some of the coolest things that I found at CES 2026, [music] like this circuit board printer. It prints a conductive liquid directly on the PCB board. Very cool. [music] But check out this metal 3D printer. It takes liquid cartridges and turns it into hard metal. Depending on which cartridge you put into it, whether it be aluminum, copper, steel, nickel, and as you can see, it can print intricate designs. But check out how you load this thing. I've never seen one like [music] this. It takes these liquid filled syringes full of liquid metal, and you just simply load it up and go. Now, I did a video on this one already, but this is the Atom Form Pallet 300 made by MOA. It's a 12 nozzle changer with [music] 36 colors. Pretty cool, and it's coming soon. Now, this isn't a printer. This is a software [music] from AF Research where they basically took machine learning and jammed it into a printer. It takes a $5 webcam and some high-tech software where it can basically [music] teach itself how to print quality prints from nothing. So, no more programming filament profiles. XL had a humongous booth. This is their apparel printer. It's a DTF printer that prints on [music] these plastic films here and it prints super vibrant color and then you just hit it with a heat press. But they're really known for their lasers and they brought [music] the F2 Ultra again with the rotary attachment and the passer attachment on the UV model. Now, the UV model is the one that can actually laser inside of crystal blocks and do the glass and [music] clear stuff. It's really nice, and so is the M1 Ultra. It's not brand new, but it's [music] still awesome. It's a laser that actually has a inkjet printer built into it that can print on top of the wood, which [music] creates endless possibilities. But this one was the talk of the show. This is their all-new UV additive printer. Unlike a UV laser that subtracts [music] material, this one adds material and it's full color. I mean, it looks absolutely wonderful. All of these were done on the new machine, and [music] I can't wait for it to launch. Then we have Create, who brought the Create High and disguised it as the allnew Sparks i7 and kind of made a new CFS. And I don't know, but the Falcon team is still on my good side because they're actually innovating and making new products. [music] And this is the allnew T1 5 in1 laser. And this is the Falcon A1C 20 watt desktop.",success,1,2026-02-08T21:26:03.833025+00:00
