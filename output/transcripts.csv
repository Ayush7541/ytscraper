paltsNeM6Y0,en,"If you've just received your first 3D printer, stop. Pausing to watch this video will save you a lot of frustration on day one. I'm not going to take any of the fun out of getting started. I just want to show you a few simple things that will help you get it working properly the first time. I've set up a lot of 3D printers over the years, and I've pretty much made every beginner mistake there is. This video is here to help you avoid those mistakes and get your first print done right without panicking if something goes wrong. This video is sponsored by Brilliant. So, first things first, whatever type of 3D printer you've got, there will be a couple of things to do before plugging it in and turning it on. Start by finding yourself a bit of space. Ideally, you want a clear tabletop, but wherever you're going to set up your printer, make sure it's clear of any clutter or mess. There can sometimes be some small parts to assemble, and you don't want to lose anything in the excitement of getting started. Take all of the parts out of the box and then lay them all out in a way that makes it easy to see everything. Remove all of the packing materials and double check that there's nothing left in the box before moving it out of the way somewhere. With every modern 3D printer, there will be a manual quick start guide or a QR code that you can scan to access a quick start guide. I'm not going to go into model specifics here, but I do have a lot of setup and review videos on my channel if you do need something more specific for your printer. This is not one of those occasions where you can bluff through without opening the manual. It's very important that you follow the first couple of steps in the guide that comes with your particular printer. With some machines, it will be cutting or removing transport fixings. With others, there may be some minimal assembly, but please don't skip this part. It won't take long, and it's very important to follow the specific instructions for your model up until the point where you turn it on. Once you've reached the part where your printer is built and it seems like you're ready to turn it on, stop. There is one last very important thing to check that could really ruin your day if you miss it. That thing is the voltage setting. This is probably one of the most important parts of the whole setup. So, don't rush it. These 3D printers are shipped all over the world, so they have to work with different countries voltages. Many 3D printers now sense the voltage automatically, but many also need setting manually. And if the setting is wrong, you could seriously damage your printer. If you do need to set the voltage manually on your printer, there'll be a switch that looks a lot like this one somewhere obvious, usually on the back or side of the printer. It should also be very obvious in the manual or quick start guide, too. What setting you need to use will depend on where you live. Most of the world uses 220 to 240 volt, while many areas of North and South America and Japan use 110 to 120 volt. If you don't know what to use, check and be sure before turning your printer on. If there's no mention of a voltage setting in your manual and no obvious switch, then it is very likely that your printer senses voltage automatically. This is very common now on new 3D printers. Have one last final check that every stage of setup from the manual has been completed and that all of the packing materials and fixings have been removed. Then plug your printer in using the provided lead only and turn it on. Most 3D printers will now take you through a short setup procedure where you select your language, enter your Wi-Fi details if you want to, and then they run through some form of automatic calibration. This can be quite quick and simple or it can be more involved. However long it takes, it's important that you let it complete fully for the very best first print experience. Before it starts, make sure your printer is on a level, flat surface, ideally in the place where you plan to use it. Modern 3D printers sense things like how much they're going to move when printing. So, if you move the printer after the calibration phase, you should really get it to do the calibration again afterwards for best results. If you made it to this point, you're doing great so far. While the printer is getting itself ready, it's time to get your filament open and ready to use. Filament is what the string-like material that 3D printers use is called. It comes supplied on rolls, and you need to handle it a little bit carefully to avoid headaches. The single most important thing to do when handling 3D printer filament is to keep hold of the end. Filament needs to unwind cleanly as your printer pulls it, and letting go of the end will very likely allow the filament to tangle. Any tangles in the filament will stop the print from completing successfully. So when you hold the filament, always hold on to the end or make sure it's tucked into the holes on the side of the spool in a way where it can't get loose. Generally, I always leave it tucked into these holes right up until the point where I'm about to feed it into the printer. So hopefully by now your printer has completed its setup and it's now time to load your filament. Every 3D printer should have a place for the filament spool to sit and rotate. Some have a horizontal post, some have rollers and bearings, and some have multifilament holders that allow multiolor printing. If you do have a multifilament printer, just load one single spool of filament for your first print. If this is your first time printing, the filament you want to be using is PLA. There are other options that allow you to do all types of things, but PLA is the most common and it's the one to start with. If you receive some filament with your printer, it will be PLA. If you don't have any filament and you need to order some, buy PLA. You don't have to spend a lot of money. Buy 1 kilogram of simple PLA. Nothing fancy, just something like black or white. And it also needs to be 1.75 mm, which most of them are. There are many different brands to choose from, and you don't need to buy anything expensive. I'll put some links in the description to budget brands I trust if you want them. Loading the filament is done slightly differently on each machine, but the basics are the same. The nozzle of the printer needs to get hot and the printer's motors need to pull the filament through. Usually after you've manually fed it in to a certain point before you feed the end of the filament into the printer, cut any kinks or bends off of the end with either some cutters or even just some scissors if you don't have cutters. This is to make sure it feeds in cleanly without snagging. One way or another, you will likely have to tell your printer that you want to load filament, except if you have a multifilament feeding unit, in which case it's often just a case of feeding the end in one at a time, and the printer will automatically heat the nozzle and load the one it wants when the print starts. Filament loading options are usually pretty obvious in your printer's screen menus, and most manuals and guides supplied with your printer cover it well. If you notice any smells or hear motor noises while loading filament, it's all very normal. Don't worry. Once your filament is loaded, you're very nearly there. The hard part's done. We're now going to find something to print. If your printer came with a USB stick or SD card, insert it and look for an option in your printer screen for print or USB or something similar. We're trying to find preloaded print files that your 3D printer manufacturer has supplied to get you started. You may have a lot of files to choose from, but pick something small. All we're doing is getting a simple first print complete. Maybe save the Flexi Dragons for later. Now, before you hit print, just some final checks. Did you load filament? Is your print surface fitted correctly? And is it clean? And have you checked that there are no obstructions on the bed or print surface? If everything's good, hit print. The printer will now heat the bed and the nozzle and probably run through a few minutes of its own checks before starting to print. Hopefully, your first print will start and complete without any issue. However, if things don't go to plan, don't panic. It's very likely to be something simple, and I'll give you a few things to check. If the filament doesn't stick to the bed and gets pulled around on the nozzle, or if anything else is obviously wrong, cancel the print on the printer's screen. This is really common on first prints, so don't worry. Ideally, with something like a pair of tweezers, remove any lumps of filament from the nozzle after it stopped moving. The reason we use tweezers is that the nozzle is still hot and you don't want to burn yourself. If there are any lines of filament, these are called purge lines, on the bed, gently remove them or let the bed cool and then remove them. Now try the same print again and carefully watch the first layer of the print going down as this is where 99% of all 3D printing problems occur. What we're going to do is to try and quickly understand what's not quite working right before we fix it. Now what we're doing here, stopping observing what's happening and figuring out what needs changing, that's problem solving. And that's exactly the reason why this video is sponsored by Brilliant. Brilliant is built around the idea that you already can figure things out. You just need the right way of learning. Instead of passively watching lessons, you work through real problems step by step using visuals and interaction until the ideas actually make sense, just like you're doing with this video. What I like about Brilliant is that it doesn't assume you're bad at math or science. It treats you like a thinker and helps you build that intuition properly. You're not memorizing formulas. You're understanding why things work. I've been using Brilliant to sharpen my own problem solving skills, especially around logical thinking and cause and effect. The exact same kind of thinking you're using when setting up and troubleshooting something like a 3D printer. Brilliant personalizes what you see based on where you're at, so you're always being challenged at the right level. And you can really feel yourself making progress as things start to click.

Brilliant also giving you 20% off an annual premium subscription which gives you unlimited access to everything on the platform. Right now, let's get back to the printer. For a 3D print to be successful, the first layer has to stick to the bed. For this to happen, a few things have to be right. The surface of the bed needs to be clean and the melted material needs to be pushed into the surface just the right amount for it to stay stuck. If the nozzle is too far away, then the filament won't be pushed into the surface enough. And if it's too close, then the nozzle will scrape on the print surface and stop the filament coming out at all. Nowadays, printers should set the nozzle position automatically. But if it's wrong, you'll see it by the way the filament that's pushed out or extruded behaves. If your printer doesn't fix this issue by running through the calibration process again, then the setting you're looking for is called Z or Z offset. If everything looks right, but the filament is just not sticking, then your print surface may be dirty. The easiest thing to clean it with is IPA or rubbing alcohol. But if you don't have any and your print surface is removable, simply wash it with soap and water and then try to only touch it on the edges afterwards. Your fingers have oils that can make it hard for prints to stick. So, you don't want to touch the print surface if you can avoid it. This should solve the vast majority of first print problems, but I've got some far more detailed deep dives on this kind of thing on my channel, and more specifically in this playlist. Once your successful first print is finished, don't try and yank it straight off the bed. It will likely be stuck quite well while everything is hot. Just leave it to cool down for a few minutes and it will likely pop right off or at least be much easier to remove. If you really can't wait and you've got a magnetic bed, then remove your print surface and put it somewhere to cool as it will release much quicker this way than leaving it on the printer. Once your removed print surface is cooled down, you can flex it which will make the print pop straight off. You can leave your printer switched on between prints. It won't use much power, but if you're not going to print anytime soon, don't switch it off straight after the print finishes. Let it cool down for 5 minutes first. This just lets everything get cooled down quicker by the fans and avoids something called heat soak. You can leave the filament loaded ready for next time, or you can use the printer screen to unload it if you don't want it sitting on the printer. Just remember to keep hold of the end if you do. Well done. You've now well and truly started your 3D printing journey. And with a successful first print done, you know that your printer is ready for all those crazy projects you actually wanted it for.

i3VycY5v-Tg,en,"What if the machine you really wanted when you bought a 3D printer finally exists? Now, I live 3D printers, but years ago when I first started looking for a machine to bring my CAD designs to life, I didn't actually want a 3D printer. What I really wanted was the ability to make functional parts, real solid components that could take load, survive in the real world, and ideally be made from metal. But desktop CNCs just weren't an option back then. There were huge, messy industrial machines that needed a dedicated workshop, and I couldn't afford them anyway. So, like a lot of people, I settled for a 3D printer. Not because it was what I truly wanted, but because it was the closest thing that existed at the time. And yes, 3D printers have come a long way. Today, you can make genuinely strong, functional parts out of advanced materials, but at the end of the day, it's still plastic. And for more than a decade, we've all been waiting for affordable metal 3D printing at home to finally become a thing. But maybe we've been looking in the wrong direction. Because the capability we've been waiting for, the ability to make real, precise, functional parts at home, might already exist. It's just called a desktop CNC. And if they do everything they claim, modern machines like the Mara Carvera Air might finally make functional part production at home a realistic option for normal people. This video is sponsored by PCBway. This Carva Air was sent to me by Makeer. I didn't buy it. However, Makea don't have any influence over what I say in the video. Now, before we go any further, I want to make something clear. I haven't just spent a week with this machine machining the sample projects and calling it a review. I've had the Car Bear Air for over 3 months and I've put hundreds of hours into it. I don't have a way to know exactly how many, but it's way more than I've ever done on any review before by a long way. I've broken tools. I've crashed jobs. I've pushed the for axis way past what it was designed for. And I've found every single place where this machine struggles and where it absolutely shines. And because I came into this with no CNC experience, I've hit every problem from a beginner perspective. So, if you want a video that shows you the real limitations, the bits the marketing doesn't mention, and the things other reviewers haven't run into yet, that's exactly what you're about to see. Because this machine is fantastic, but it isn't perfect. And I've pushed it far enough to know exactly where the line is. So, let me show you exactly what happened when I put this machine to work. The first thing I was concerned about when I agreed to try out the Carva Air was how much other stuff I'd have to buy just to get it set up and working. When I tried my first laser engraver, I was annoyed that they didn't send me any laser safe goggles. I had to not only buy my own, but I had to research what I even needed to keep my eyes safe. Maya assured me that almost everything would be supplied in the box, but to keep the price down on the air, there was no compressor and no vacuum for cleaning machine material. Whilst I'd never used a CNC machine before, I did know that tooling can get expensive. And the last thing I wanted to be doing on day one was researching what tooling I needed to buy just to make my first thing. I didn't have worried though, as the version I was sent came with a huge selection of tool bits, far more than I knew what to do with, and many of which I still don't know what to do with. The ones I use for almost all of the jobs I've run are the ones you receive in even the most stripped down, lowest price package. So, I don't believe you need to invest in the full milling bit package straight away. Save that for when you know you need more varied tooling down the line. What you also get is a comprehensive pack of material that allows you to make all of the example projects and a guide to show you how to make all of those example projects. You also get a manual for the machine itself. After looking through everything I've been sent, I realized that the Carba Air comes 99% complete and there's actually very little you need to do before starting your first job. I was a little stumped by the manual's instruction to check that the power supply switch was in the correct voltage setting as I couldn't find a switch anywhere. It turns out that my model didn't have one, but I only found this out by removing panels and peering through vents. Once I was sure that the voltage was right, though, I switched it on and it immediately moved all the axis to their home positions, ready to start, just like a 3D printer does really. I followed the guide which said to fit the arm to the side of the machine, but I never actually used it. The arm's there so that you can run the machine from an Android device if you have one. I don't, so I just used a laptop instead. Now, this is the first difference I found to something like a 3D printer. Nowadays, with 3D printer, you have an in-built controller with a screen that lets you run all of the functions on the machine. With the carba and I believe most desktop CNCs, it's a bit different. The machine has a similar control board to run everything locally, but other than one button, there are no controls on the machine itself. Everything is controlled by software that you run on a separate Windows laptop, Mac or Android device. This device initially needs to connect via USB, but after giving it your network details, you can use your Wi-Fi network to connect them wirelessly. In this way, the CNC machine is a lot more similar to a laser engraver than a 3D printer. I didn't mind it, but if I didn't have a laptop, Mac, or Android device that I was prepared to leave next to my CNC for hours on end, I might have found this a problem. Once you install the controller software on whatever device you plan to use and connect it to your Carva Air, is very simple to upload and run prepared G-code files. The example files come ready to go, and once you start the job, it runs locally. You aren't relying on your Wi-Fi network being active the whole time to prevent the machine from stopping. If you do want to stop a job in a hurry, there's an emergency stop button that you need to put somewhere obvious. And of course, one hit of the button and everything stops immediately. As I said, there is one button on the machine which is at the top and it's used for telling the machine when you've completed a task like fitting a probe or changing a tool. The Carva Air relies on manual tool changes unfortunately, but its bigger brother, the Carva, is able to complete automatic changes to the next tool you want to run when one operation is finished. When it comes to setting up the first example jobs, first you need to fit what's called spoil board to the bed, which is a sacrificial layer that you slightly cut into, which allows you to cut all the way through materials that are sitting flat. Unlike a 3D printer with a CNC machine, you need to secure the material to the bed with some kind of clamp or fixture. And the Carver Air comes with a number of these and other fixings and guides to line everything up. What I really liked about the example jobs that I started with was that the guide book actually shows you exactly what clamps to use and where, so that there's no room for error while you're learning the basics. The example job guide also tells you what tooling to use. So, all you have to do is find what you need in the supplied tool kit and have it ready. I started with a 3D relief that's machined out of epoxy board. So, after fitting it down as shown and getting my tooling ready, I was able to select the cutting file as shown in the book. Once you have the file load in the controller software, you can run through the tool path on screen to see what it plans to do before you hit start. But before you hit start, you have to tell it whereabouts on the bed you want it to start, just like a laser engraver. You then hit run and you're told to load the probe. The probe is a combination of something very similar to a 3D printer's touch probe and a laser pointer. After probing a calibration post on the back of the bed, it then draws a box around the area it will start machining. With the example jobs, you're given all of the correct offsets to use. But when you come to aligning your own jobs, this is very useful to make sure you've not got something wrong. The probe also then, just like a 3D printer, probes the material you're about to machine, so it knows where the top surface is for when the tool is fitted. It then returns to its starting position, and you're instructed to fit the first tool. As I said, tool changes on the Cera Air are manual, but they're also very quick. All you have to do is pull down the lever on the side, and one tool drops out. You then insert the next tool and lift the lever back up, and it's done. All you have to do then is press the button on the top to say that you've changed the tool and after probing the post on the back of the bed to set the tool height, the spindle starts and your job starts to run. It's best to close the cover before hitting the button for safety and to prevent any of the machine material from coming out and making a mess. I was actually surprised how well the cover works at keeping the mess inside the enclosure. Whilst the cover feels a little flimsy when it's up, when it's down, magnets hold it in place and there are brushed strips along all the joints that work really well at containing everything. For this job, I just let it run without any kind of vacuum or compressor as I didn't have either, which meant quite a lot of buildup of material as it's removed but not moved away. I couldn't really see what was going on. So, I went and got a portable vacuum we use in the house and tried putting it up to the port on the side of the machine. There's a vacuum shield around the cutting area, which works really well at providing a contained area for the vacuum. Even this small portable Hoover just pushed up to the port did a really good job of removing most of the waste. Once the roughing's done, you get a beep to tell you it's time to change the tool to a finishing bit. And then off it goes again. This time taking a different path to pick out all of the detail of the design. You then switch back to the first tool so that it can cut your piece out, leaving only a few tabs in place that you remove by hand afterwards. With a little bit of clean up with the supplied sanding block, you're done and you've completed your first CNC job, which I have to say is of a very high quality. When you're used to 3D printed parts with their layer lines and Minecraft looking steps on curves, seeing these super smooth surfaces from a desktop machine is very impressive. And for three axis jobs at least, that's it. That's the whole process that you basically just repeat for each job. The only thing that changes is the way you set up the tool paths in the CAM or computed aided manufacturing software, which I will get to in a minute. Next, rather than just running through all the example jobs, I wanted to learn more. So, I decided to change the design on the LED lamp job. With this job, you machine an acrylic base that houses a supplied PCB board and an aluminium button that you machine yourself into this. You slot a clear acrylic panel that you also machine. But I wanted to change the design and add my logo. Now, firstly, not only did everything go exactly as shown in the guide book, but I was very impressed to see the absolute precision with which everything fitted together. I keep coming back to 3D printing analogies, but I feel like so many people have 3D printers now. It's the most relatable comparison. With the melted plastic in 3D printing, this kind of precision is unthinkable. If you want something to fit together this well, then it either takes some trial and error with changing tolerances or you simply have to finish the part yourself with a file or a knife. It was at this stage that I also treated myself to a new shop fact. Not because it was absolutely necessary, but because I needed one anyway, and this made a good excuse to get the one I wanted. I bought the DeWalt supersonic which I can highly recommend if you need a shopvac. The sound of the air going down the hose is actually louder than the motor noise and it has an extremely good amount of suction. I 3D printed a fitting that bolts to the side of the cara. So anytime I want extraction, I just plug it in. As I say, you don't need to go out and buy a new shop fact just for this machine. But for threeaxis or flat jobs, some kind of vacuum helps. But you can use anything for this, even a household vacuum. For modifying the standard design of the lamp, I needed to learn how to use mayer's cam software, which is very cleverly named Mara Cam. Make cam doesn't have to run on the same machine that you use to control your cara if it isn't on the same machine. You just have to transfer the output file in the same way that you do with a 3D printer or a laser engraver. I've come to find that maker cam is relatively simple to use. But just like any new software like this, I was a bit lost the first time I fired it up. You don't have to worry though as unlike a lot of 3D printing manufacturers, Mayera have put a lot of effort into providing resources to help you understand every stage of using their machines. They have an extremely comprehensive series of videos on their YouTube channel and a wiki page where you can read about anything to do with using one of their machines. This really impressed me and even after months of using this machine, I still refer to the wiki and Makeer's YouTube channel to this day. It didn't take long for me to find the right video that guided me through what I needed to do to add the logo to the lamp design. Once this was done, I also needed to choose what tools to use to actually machine it. Again, this does have a steep learning curve that is helped massively by a make error. Within make error cam, there's a tool library. You do need to know some basics about what you're trying to achieve with a tool and what material you're trying to cut. But once you've selected a couple of simple details, default values are pulled through into the tool path window so that you don't have to sit and calculate things like chip loading, feeds and speeds, and any of the other headacheinducing jargon that turns most people off of CNC machining. All of the complicated stuff is handled so that you only need to make a couple of decisions. It's not quite as automated as using a 3D printer slicer, but it's similar to setting up a laser engraving job, which is pretty simple once you've done it a few times. I was fully expecting my first bespoke job to be a complete failure, but to my surprise, it turned out perfect and better than I ever could have imagined. I'd avoided CNC machining for years because it seemed so complicated. But with the way Maker have everything set up, it wasn't anywhere near as daunting as I'd thought. And actually, this is a good moment to talk about today's sponsor, PCB Way. If you want to get something CNC machined, but aren't yet able to invest in a desktop CNC like the Carvera Air, then PCB Way is the place to go. Alongside their well-known PCB fabrication and assembly services, PCB way also offer full CNC machining in aluminium, brass, copper, steel, and engineering plastics. And the entire ordering process happens directly on their website. If you go to the CNC machining section, you can upload a step file, choose your material, surface finish, tolerances, threads, and you get an instant quote right there on the page. It's extremely straightforward, especially if you're coming from the 3D printing world. And if you're working on electronics projects too, they make PCB manufacturing just as simple. Upload your gerbers, pick your board thickness and solder mask color, and you can preview the price before ordering. It pairs really nicely with what this desktop CNC can already do. You can prototype PCBs at home and then get a full production version made properly. So whether you want precision machine metal parts or professionallymade circuit boards, the whole process on PCBway's website is very intuitive. Check out PCBway.com for more information. Now that I had a couple of successful CNC jobs under my belt, I moved on to the part that I was most excited about, which was fourth axis machining. Three-axis machining, surprisingly just uses three axes, X, Y, and Zed, or Z. What the fourth axis does is introduce another axis that rotates your material, allowing you to machine shapes that don't have to sit flat on the bed. This means that you can machine all sorts of different shapes that you otherwise can't. The fourth axis just bolts down to the bed and is precisely aligned with locating pins. The stated maximum stock size is 92 mm diameter and 200 mm long, but I'll tell you in a bit why I found that to not quite be true, and I did thoroughly test it. You can't run the dust shoe around the spindle when you use the fourth axis, which basically rules out using any kind of vacuum. Instead, especially with materials like aluminium, you're advised to run some kind of compressed air to clear machine material away from the cutting area. I didn't have a compressor to use for this, but I did have an air assist pump from a laser engraver, which is actually pretty perfect for this job, and you can pick these up for around $20. And they provide just enough of an airirstream to do the job. And they're quiet and small, unlike most shop compressors. There is a fourth axis example job using epoxy board again. So, I followed the instructions and set it running. I was beginning to trust the Carbara Air a little now, so I dared to do some other stuff while periodically checking in on it. When I returned, I found that the air assist and lack of extraction had meant that all of the cut material had been blasted all around the inside of the machine, which looked like it was going to take ages to clean up. However, I was really happy to see that as it was all dry, it vacuumed up really easily, especially with my new DeWalt machine. So, just like with three axis jobs, after roughing the shape out, you change the tool bit to a finishing bit and let it do its thing. Again, the result is beautiful with every tiny detail picked out. For anyone used to making small figurines with an FDM 3D printer, this kind of quality is pretty staggering and only usually possible with resin printing, which unfortunately also comes with a lot of mess. It was at this point where I'd had enough with the example jobs and decided to learn how to use make error cam to create my own tool path from scratch. So I found a chest piece STL file and imported it. Make error cam can work with a number of file types. You can import 2D files like SVG, DXF, JPEG, PNG and bitmap. Also Gerber files for PCB layouts if you want to make PCBs with your cara air which you absolutely can do. You can also import 3D files in the form of STL, OBJ, and step files. The chest piece was an STL, which I believe I found on Maker World. I tried to keep things simple by using the same single flute endmill that Maker seem to use for roughing out all of their example jobs, and then finishing up with the same 0.3 mm 30° engraving bit. All I did was select hardwood when selecting the tool. As I was making this part from oak, and again, default values were pulled through. I was curious as to when I might need to start looking into how these different settings affect the way the tools work. And you can absolutely dive head first into all of that information, but with Mara Cam, you don't really have to. I actually being the curious fellow that I am asked chat PT about what all of the settings meant. And whilst I learned quite a lot, I was happy to continue using the default settings, at least for now. To get the material ready, I cut it roughly to the right length and then drilled a hole in the middle for the tailtock to locate in. Very much like the example fourfaxis job. This went really well. But I did actually run it again as the piece of oak dal I used had a split in it which I hadn't noticed. I was really keen to machine metal though and happened to have the same diameter piece of brass which I prepped and set up the same way. Unfortunately, this was the first point where my inexperience showed. As soon as the longer tool touched the stock, it shattered. This, I learned, was a combination of a longer tool that needed different settings and me not understanding that it's pretty important how the tool enters the material, especially with harder stuff like metals. What I should have done was enabled ramping, which gently moves the tool from side to side while plunging or moving down to avoid overstressing the tool. I also used a shorter tool bit to reduce stress. All it took was watching another video or two to learn this, but I was too impatient to get started with making shiny bits. Whilst it takes a bit longer as you have to machine material away in smaller steps, machining things out of metal follows the same process as any softer materials. Another lesson I learned on this job was that when creating a roughing tool path, it's best to leave a little bit of material rather than machining all the way down to the model surface. Also, this is where I believe I found one issue with the way Maker Cam handles fourth axis jobs. You see, you can set what's called a depth allowance when creating a tool path, but from what I can see, it only adds an allowance to the Z axis. It doesn't leave an allowance all over the model. To do this, it would also have to add an allowance on the X-axis, which it doesn't. What this means is if you have any vertical or nearly vertical surfaces, the roughing tool will machine right up to the model surface. When you try to follow this up with a tool with a smaller end, because of the tool geometry, it can't get in as close to the vertical surface to clean it up. This may be a common thing with this type of machining, but it seems that allowing an offset in X as well as zed would leave a cleaner final surface, even if it might not technically be as dimensionally accurate. Anyway, I made it work, and with a bit of cleanup, I'm really pleased with the result. From here, I tried to use the Carvera Air to machine some polyurethane skateboard wheels, which meant 3D printing a fixture to be able to hold it in the chuck, as the external diameter was larger than the chuck would go to, and there was no internal diameter that the chuck could grip. This job was also where I discovered the limitation on stock diameter with the fourth axis. 92 mm is indeed the size of material that technically fits in the fourth axis if you find a way to hold it with the chuck as the jaws don't go that big. And technically, if you use a very short bit, the spindle will clear the material and be able to machine it. However, firstly, if you try to use the probe on anything over about 76 mil in diameter to line the job up, it will crash into the stop and break it. You can turn this off though, which gets you around that problem, but if you forget, it's bye-bye probe. However, the bigger problem is that no matter what settings you use for safe positions and clearance height, with stock this big, make cam will try to move the tool to a Z position that triggers the Carva Air's soft limits. These are firmware axis limits that keep the machine from moving to the actual axis physical limits and triggers a tool path ending error when it reaches that section in the G-code. There's no reason to try and move this far either. I found that trying to move to anything over about 39 millimeters on the X-axis triggers the soft limit which actually gives you 78 mm of usable stock diameter without triggering the limits. However, even when your stock is smaller, make still tries to move the tool above the 39 mm limit. You can turn the soft limits off in the controller firmware, but I wasn't comfortable doing this. So, what I did instead was manually modify the G-code. This was only a case of using Notepad++ to search for any Z coordinate above 39 mm and reduce it to 39 mm and then the job runs with no issue. I was happy to do this as to a degree I understand the G-code, but how many others will want to do this? I imagine not many, and I'm sure it's something that could be fixed in the software. Knowing about this bug, I decided to see if I could make something that used a full usable fourthaxis capacity on the Makeer Carva Air. So, I designed a trophy using a CAD file from a crash helmet I found online and then a support that I modeled myself. The idea was to make a trophy for a fantasy Formula 1 league that I'm part of and incidentally have no chance of winning. Setup was a lot more difficult as I don't have any kind of band saw or chopsaw to cut through 3-in of solid aluminium. So, I had to do it with a hacksaw which took ages. I actually did it over a few days, cutting until my arm gave out and then coming back later to try again. I did it though and I also had to 3D print a step down end cap which I drilled, tap, bolted, and glued to the end of the stock. Everything started well and after quite a few hours of machining, the shapes were starting to appear. Unfortunately, it was at this point that I ran into the first drama with this job. I had a power cut. And unlike a lot of 3D printers, there's no default way to restart a job once it stopped with the cara. I really didn't want to start the G-code from scratch and leave the job air cutting for hours on end until it caught up to where it got to. Whilst figuring out what I was going to do, I tried to open the job up again in Make Heracam, only to discover that whilst there was a save file, it was empty. I'd lost all of the information about model position, scale, everything. I still had the G-code from the roughing tool path, but I hadn't yet created any other tool paths, so I had no way to finish the job once the roughing was done. This was almost a disaster for me as I didn't have it in me to cut through another 3 in of material by hand or repeat all of the other work done so far. After a lot of measuring and after hours of work, I managed to approximate the position of the main section, which was the main part I was worried about. It took a lot of trial and error with small changes and lots of saves. But I discovered that if you try and work on a model this complicated and of this size, the resulting tool paths create such huge G-code files that saving after creating a tool path causes makeanam to crash and not save. The workaround is to save a backup before creating tool paths. So at least you don't lose everything if it falls over like it did with me. So, the only way I could continue the job roughly from where I left off without air cutting for hours and hours was to again manually modify the G-code by chopping out all of the completed code and then hacking what was left to trick the machine into thinking it had already completed. Well, it hadn't. It worked, but it wasn't pretty. We don't have time here to go into all of the issues I found with this job. But by this point, I felt it was time to talk to make error and ask them why I was having all of the problems that I was encountering. Expecting the usual response of either not really understanding the problems I was having or somehow implying that I was doing something wrong. I was pleasantly surprised to get a very open receptive response. I was asked to provide details of the issues and I also sent over all of the information about the job I was trying to run so that they could try to see if they experienced the same problems. After confirming that there were some issues with Mera Cam when using the fourth axis section, Mera said that they were working to iron out the bugs. They explained to me that they began as a machine manufacturer and that they used to advise that users use other CAM software. However, they realized that these other software options could be overwhelming and complicated. So, they decided to try and create their own with the aim of making it userfriendly. They admit that Maceram isn't perfect for all applications. And after I sent them all of the details of what I was trying to do, they advised that most of the issues I was having was because of the size of the part I was trying to machine and the level of detail I was trying to achieve, which I have to agree with. The smaller foraxis jobs had very few issues. Maker actually encouraged me to share all of the issues I'd had with my viewers. They didn't shy away from them, and they also pointed to their GitHub report page where users can leave their issues so that they can be fixed in later versions. Once this video is finished, I will do that and then all of my findings can go into improving what could be very useful free software once all of the bugs are ironed out. So, eventually I did get the trophy job finished, but not before I messed up one stage of G-code hacks, which meant that I sliced out a section that shouldn't have been machined, which I then filled with epoxy to try and hide it. It didn't work. After some clean up with some files, wet and dry, and my fantic rotary tool, I've eventually ended up with a piece that isn't perfect, but I'm very happy with the result, especially with all the drama I had to go through to get it. Just for fun, I 3D printed the same file on my Bamboo Lab P2S. And while the 3D printing took a fraction of the time, I know which one I would rather have sitting on my mantle piece. So, what I learned from this mammoth job was that if you want to machine larger diameter hard materials with a lot of detail, make cam is not going to be the best software to use until it's improved further. However, for slightly smaller diameters and all three axis jobs, it's very good. And with all of this said, all of the problems I had were softwarebased. The Carva Air has never missed a beat. It's awesome. When the software catches up, this will be one hell of a package. So, let's quickly go through some of the things I haven't covered, but you will want to know. With threeaxis machining, you have a work area of 300 by 200 mm and a stock tooling height of 130 mm, unless you need to use longer tooling, in which case that height is reduced so that you don't have the tooling crash into the stock. As we discovered, the fourth axis size limitations are more softwarebased, and if you want to avoid all the issues I found, you probably need to keep the stock diameter below about 60 mm. Once all of the bugs are worked out though, larger diameters should be less hassle. The spindle is 200 W and is spec to 13,000 RPM. However, the hard limit is actually 15,000, which I tested quite a bit. The standard collet size is 1/8 of an inch or 3.175 mm, but you can change these to 1/4 in and 6 mm versions if you want to use other tooling. Cooling is by air alone, which basically means there's no cooling, just a tube and a nozzle that you can blow air down to remove chips. There's no liquid cooling option, which does limit what you can machine. Make say that machining steel and titanium is possible, but it's not advised for prolonged processing. What you can very realistically machine is wood, foam, plastic, carbon fiber, and softer metals like aluminium, copper, and brass. As we've discussed at length, the software Maker advise you to use is Maker Cam, which is pretty good, and it's free. However, there are other options, and it's very likely that there's a better option for fouraxis machining, but it won't be free. Other CAM software that you can use with Makeare is CNC machines includes Fusion 360, Solid Works, AutoCAD, VCarve Pro, Aspire, and Illustrator. Since I started my testing, controller software compatibility has been updated to say that it now works with iOS as well as Android, Mac OS, Windows, and Linux. So, there are a lot more options when it comes to controller devices. Now, there are also plans for a very soonto-bereleased new software called Makeer Studio, which should make it even easier for beginners. From what I've seen, it adds a 3D printer style UI to Make Cam, which should make it more familiar to 3D printing users and reduce the steepness of the learning curve for beginners. I did ask, but unfortunately, Mera Studio won't resolve all of the fourth axis issues I encountered during my testing. Those will have to be resolved in future updates. Make error also plan a bamboo lab maker world style project sharing platform so that people can share their projects in the same way that 3D printer users do. As you can see there's a big drive towards emulating the success of 3D printing which I think will attract more people to desktop CNCs and rightly so. Mera used Kickstarter to get the Carva and the Carvera Air off the ground and they're doing the same with their new Z1 which will be another lowerc cost machine that will lower the barrier of entry for CNC newcomers. You can buy the Carva and Carva Air right now and the Z1 will be along shortly. If you're quick, there's still time to get in on the Kickstarter, but not for long. And I have no experience with the Z1, only the Carva Air. Even with some of the headaches that I've worked through, I really enjoyed every stage of testing the Carver Vera Air. And I absolutely love the results you can achieve. There are a lot of other jobs I've played around with that I haven't shown here, and there will be a lot more in the near future as I continue to make more things with this high precision machine. I feel like I've only scratched the surface of what it can do, and the potential is huge once the software catches up. But as of right now, is it time to invest in a desktop CNC like the Carva Air? I think so. But what do you think? Are the software bugs too big of an issue, or are these machines still just way too expensive? Let me know in the comments. Remember, there are links to everything I've discussed in this video in the description below if you want to see pricing and availability. Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.",success,1,2026-01-30T17:57:18.081051+00:00
z-S0YlIrZIM,en,"Black Friday deals can be confusing. So, I did things differently. I've spent the last month speaking directly with the manufacturers I've worked with to confirm the actual Black Friday prices, not just whatever's floating around online. These are verified straight from the source deals unless I explicitly say otherwise. And in some cases, I've even managed to negotiate extra discounts specifically for you. So, this is a fast, noonsense rundown of the deals that are genuinely worth considering. Generally through the video, I'll be quoting prices in US dollars as the USA is where most of my viewers live. And whilst it's difficult to test conclusively, all the deals should be available everywhere. Some of these deals will be very short-lived and some will be around a lot longer. And as you might expect, the description is where you can go for all the links and discount codes. So, let's quickly go through the deals that I think are worth your attention. This video is sponsored by Brilliant. So, let's start with 3D printers. This time of year is notoriously the best time to buy a 3D printer with manufacturers slashing prices everywhere. So, what are the best deals going? Now, in no particular order, we'll start with Flash Forge, who have deals on their three main models, the 5M, the 5M Pro, and the AD5X, which you can now buy for only $319, plus an extra discount if you use my discount code, Ricky10. Don't be confused by the price that you see on the website though. If you use my link and the discount code when you go through to check out that additional discount will be applied. Heygears, who are well known for their resin printers, have between 20 and 35% discounts on all their machines. Plus, you get an extra $50 off with the discount code Ricky Imp. Any Cubic have discounts on all their machines with the best deal being 38% off a Cobra S1 combo. Plus, there are additional discounts with the codes in the description, which boost that discount to over 40%. Eligu have discounts across all their machines that vary depending where you are, but you can pick up a Centuri Carbon for $279 in the US or £299 or only £240 in the UK. That is a lot of printer for the money, even though it does now seem that we won't be getting multiolor printing on this particular model as was originally hoped. However, if you're looking for a solid Corxy printer on a budget, this is probably the best you'll find right now. Check out my review of the Century Carbon if you want to know what I thought of it. Bamboo Lab traditionally slashed their prices at this time of year, and 2025 is no exception. If you're looking to buy a 3D printer as a present for someone new to 3D printing and just want something that works straight out of the box, then I have to say that for 99% of cases, buying a Bamboo Lab machine is going to be the best option. Their best discount is on the P1S combo with the AMS2 Pro where you can save 46% off the previous price. This is very likely because they're trying to run stock down on this slightly older model because of the new P2S which Bamboo Lab seem to be struggling to get on the shelves in some places. However, the P1S is still a very good printer and it's worth picking up with this bargain price. If you are buying for a beginner, then pretty much all Bamboo Lab models are beginner friendly. So, see what fits your budget. The A1 and the A1 Mini are still 3D printers that I rate very highly, and the prices keep coming down. If your budget can stretch to one of the combo models, then this will allow multiolor printing, not just one. There's roughly 30% off the A1 models right now. Creity have discounts across the board, but I can't tell you much more than what you'll find yourself on the website, as Creality don't seem to want to talk to me anymore. I don't know why, and believe me, I've tried on multiple occasions. they just don't seem to want to work with me anymore. I did get some basic information, but it doesn't seem to match what I could see on the website. So, my advice would be if you have your eye on a Creality machine, just have a look for yourself and see if the current discounts help you out. So, or so, I'm never really sure how to say that, have some small discounts. It's around 10% on their three main printer models. As I say, these are all manufacturers that I've worked with in some capacity. So, if you are thinking about a particular deal, check out my videos to see if I reviewed that particular model and see what I thought of it before buying. Don't worry, though. There won't be any links to any of the bad ones. If you do decide to pick up something in the sales, whether it's a 3D printer, a laser engraver, whatever, there's one thing that always comes with it, a whole new set of things to learn. And honestly, one of the things I like the most about getting a new machine is learning how to use it. Figuring out the quirks, understanding the tech behind it, getting better one setting at a time. That's half the fun. So, this is the perfect moment to say thank you to today's sponsor, Brilliant. Brilliant is a learning app that helps you become a better thinker and problem solver with visual interactive lessons across math, science, programming, data, and even AI. I've been going through their digital circuits and scientific thinking lessons recently, and it scratches the same itch. You learn by actually doing things. You drag components around, test ideas, and build intuition step by step. It's way more engaging than just watching a lecture. Or if you love the analytical side of dialing in a new machine, their exploring data visually course is brilliant for spotting patterns and making sense of all the little variables we deal with in 3D printing. You can start learning for free by going to brilliant.org/ ricky or by scanning the QR code you see on the screen. And Brilliant is giving my viewers 20% off an annual premium subscription, so you get unlimited access to everything. All right, speaking of learning new things, one maker tool that definitely comes with a learning curve, but can completely change your workflow is a 3D scanner. And there are actually some really good Black Friday deals on those this year. 3D Maker Pro have between 20 and 50% discounts on Moose, Seal, Mole, Lynx, Eagle, and Touan 3D scanners. My experience with 3D scanners has always been a little bit disappointing, but I'm currently discussing trying out the Tukan, which is an all-in-one scanner that doesn't need to be plugged into a high-spec PC to use it, and I'm hoping this solves most of the issues that I've had in the past. There's 30% off the Touan in the Black Friday sales, but up to 50% off some of the other models. Watch this space for a Toucan review hopefully coming soon. Creity also have some discounts on their 3D scanners, but do your research before buying any of their basic models. As I've said, I've never had a lot of joy with them, and I haven't shied away from telling you about it, which, thinking about it now, is possibly why they no longer want to talk to me. So, how about some other machines like laser engravers and now desktop CNC? You won't have seen it yet, but I've been thoroughly testing the Makeer Air desktop CNC, which I'll be reviewing in my very next video. Now, I imagine that you'll probably want to see that review before dropping a sizable chunk on a CNC machine, but spoiler alert, I absolutely love this machine, and there are massive discounts of up to $800 to be had right now, and I'm pushing hard to get that review out before the sale period ends. So, hit subscribe if you don't want to miss that one. Xol. I've reviewed a number of X tool products over the past couple of years, and without fail, I've always loved their desktop machines, including things like laser engravers. Xtool guarantee that these are their lowest prices of the year with up to 32% off in some places. If you haven't seen it yet, their brand new F2 Ultra looks great and has some heavy discounts along with their other machines. Now, alongside their 3D printers and 3D scanners, Creity have discounts on their laser engravers like the Falcon 2 Pro I reviewed last year. Again, it looks like you can save up to $800 on some Creality laser engravers, but check them out for yourself. Sculp Fun have tiered pricing depending how much you spend, plus an additional discount code just for you in the description, so check that out if you want to buy anything from Sculp Fun. If you already have a 3D printer, then Black Friday sales are a really good time to pick up raw materials like filaments and resins. Some manufacturers are only offering discounts when you bulk buy and others just have some great low prices at the moment. Any Cubic and Bamboo Lab have some good discounts if you want to bulk buy your filament. But if you want to just buy some individual rolls for some low prices, then one place to go is Sunloo who have PETG and ABS for only $8.99 with PLA at only $9.99. There are also discounts on their other filaments, but those are the headlines. And there's also additional discounts if you buy in bulk with them, too. Tinmory have discounts on all of their filament with up to 38% off their TPU and PETG, which includes their glass fiber and carbon fiber PETG. They also have discounts on their brand new ASA and ABS Pro filament. GTE have 30 to 35% discount on many different filaments which I'm currently trying out and you will need to use my discount code to get that full discount again in the description. And Hars have resin with up to 55% discount. And then in the others category we've got 3D printer accessories from companies like Mion and BQ. Mention have 10 to 20% off a lot of their 3D printing accessories, including a really useful tool kit, their Neuto Press heat insert tool, and their 3D printer filtration system, all of which they've sent to me to try out. BQ make a whole range of 3D printer upgrades and accessories. Their Panda range is specific to Bamboo Lab machines. Their discounts depend on how much you spend when you use again the codes in the description. Fantic. They make useful tools like the E2 precision screwdriver and F2 Master mini cordless rotary which I've been testing for the last couple of months and I love them. They're really useful for cleaning up things like 3D prints and more recently CNC machine parts. They have up to 45% off if you use the discount codes. So or Sovil have a small discount on their new SH03 filament dryer, but this could be the best value filament dryer available, but I need to try it out to see how it performs. Now, there are some manufacturers who didn't get back to me with their Black Friday deals in time to make the video. But if their deals look good, then I will add them to the description below. And let me and others know what the best Black Friday deals are that you found in the comments below. Also, can I please ask that you use a little caution with these Black Friday deals? We all love a bargain, but please make sure you don't overstretch yourself just because prices are lower. Make sure it's something you actually need. Thanks for watching. I hope this has been useful, and I'll see you in the next one.",success,1,2026-01-30T17:57:53.083074+00:00
V-Ka02Ks4fM,en,"When I asked you how you currently store your filament or how you would like to, I expected a few tips. Instead, I got a huge response, including some fantastic ideas, ranging from simple vacuum bags to highly complex vending machines and walk-in dry cabinets. So, today we're taking all of that feedback and designing filament storage 2.0 built by the 3D printing community. This video is sponsored by PCB Way. In video one of this series, I outlined some of the problems I believe we currently have with filament storage. It needs to be kept dry and clean. We need to store it in a neat, compact way. We need to keep track of what we've got. It needs to be ready to use when we want it. And we need to access everything easily. I asked you if you agreed that we had a problem that needed fixing. And what I got was a resounding yes. What I also got from your comments was a fantastic overview of what the whole 3D printing community was currently doing with their filament. And whilst there were some surprises, it was good to see that I was generally on the right track with my thinking. However, what has become very clear is that there is a much wider variety of needs than I probably realized, and I really want this project to help everyone in the community, not just people who work in a similar way to me. What I've done then is analyzed every single comment posted on that video up to this point and used it to create an outline of a road map for moving forward. In this video, I'm going to show you what people asked for and how we're going to use that information to create filament storage 2.0. So, first off, when I analyzed every comment, I found two patterns. Half of you have already hacked together your own storage systems, boxes, bags, even wine fridges. The other half are imagining what doesn't yet exist. Smart, modular, even automated ways to keep filament dry and organized. That's the gap we're going to bridge with filament storage 2.0. Of the comments telling me what you are currently doing, it was another relatively even split. 52% of you use single spool solutions like dry boxes or vacuum bags and 44% use some sort of multis-spool storage like a cabinet. I had some very long and detailed comments from some of you, which I really appreciate. One of the ones that stood out was from Mark Booth 3066, who said, ""We're currently using a mix of vacuum bags and round tubs, mostly 2,000 ml with some 2500ml round tubs for those annoyingly wide spools. Each bag or tub has a desicant holder and hydrometer frame. This allows us to read humidity without opening the bag."" Europa said, ""I have a small collection of spools and I'm storing them in Rubbermaid cereal boxes. I have a humidistat hot glued on the inside facing out and use calcium chloride in a tea infuser bag to keep humidity around 10%."" For the cabinet solution, RPM3D said, ""I have an IKEA Billy wardrobe with self-made brackets and use aluminium rods and self-made name tag holders."" The wardrobe is kind of sealed and has a humidity sensor with a dehumidifier machine which starts if a defined percentage has been reached. I also created a website/ app for myself to have an overview of my filament and all my spare parts. And Perkins SP or Perkins P said I have a display fridge that I got from Facebook Marketplace and put a dehydrator in the bottom. I keep around 40 filaments there. There are also a couple of comments with some of you experimenting with inline drying, which is not something I'd given a lot of thought to. However, it doesn't take much to tempt me down a rabbit hole. And after reading these comments, I spent quite a while researching if it's even possible to dry your filament as it's on the way to your printer. This would obviously solve one of the biggest problems in one go and make all of the others a lot easier to solve. And it turns out that technically it is possible and there are a couple of systems out there that you can buy right now. However, they are horrendously expensive and probably not an option for the vast majority of us. We shouldn't rule this out, though, and I think it's definitely worth some further investigation. So, we now know what a lot of people are currently doing, but I also asked for ideas on what you would want in an ideal setup. These comments were a lot of fun to read through, and there were some great ideas, some very practical and doable, and others that would be a real challenge, which could give us some great end goals for this whole project. So what was very interesting to see is that the ideas for the physical storage solutions fit into just four categories. 38% of people want a simple large mass storage solutions like a cabinet but with some of the problems of this method solved or improved. 28% want not only single small solutions like dry boxes but there was a clear message that there is a need for active dry boxes not just boxes that you put some desicant in. This was very interesting to me and really sparked some ideas for what we can do, which I'll go through shortly. 23% of the requests were for some form of automated all-in-one solution. Pretty much what I was thinking initially. This would be basically like a vending machine or jukebox where all of your filament is fully maintained and when you want it, you press a button and it's brought to you. Very cool, very complicated and massive overkill for most people. I still think we should do it though. And then finally, around 10% of people want us to look at inline drying as I mentioned a little while ago. So, you asked, let's do it. Those are our four routes for filament storage 2.0. Active single spool dry boxes, large simple cabinet storage, a fully automated vending machine, and inline drawing. With these four options, I believe there's something for everyone, no matter what scale your filament storage problem. So, those are our four directions for filament storage 2.0. And honestly, seeing how many creative ideas came from the community has been amazing. This video is sponsored by PCBway, who make it incredibly easy to turn those kinds of ideas into real engineered parts. If you've ever wanted to take your 3D printed prototype further, maybe build a custom PCB to control humidity or air flow, get precision CNC machine parts for a cabinet mechanism, or even have a housing injection molded. PCB Way can handle all of it under one roof. They offer PCB prototyping and assembly, CNC machining, 3D printing, sheet metal fabrication and injection molding. So whether you're making one prototype or a full product, you can go from idea to finished part fast and ordering is straightforward. Just upload your design files like Gerbers for PCBs or STL or step files for 3D printing and CNC. Choose your material and quantity and get an instant quote right there on the website. If you're the kind of person who loves designing clever projects like these, PCB way are also running their eighth project design contest where you can share your builds, get featured, and even win prizes. I'll leave a link in the description if you want to check it out. Now, let's start exploring how we can actually bring those four storage ideas to life. Now, we're not going to come up with solutions for all of these in one video. However, what we can do now is start brainstorming how we're going to tackle each one. Now again, I received many fantastic comments on the first video in this series, but still only around 10% of people who watched the video actually commented. So even if you don't have any particular ideas that you want to share, can I ask that you very simply let me know which of these four solutions you think you will be most interested in? That way I can gauge the wider interest and decide what to focus on first. So, if you like the active drybox option, simply comment with the number one. For a large simple cabinet, comment two. For the full-on vending machine or jukebox, comment three. And for inline drawing, comment with the number four. You can comment with more than one number if you like. I'll scoop up everything from the comments and use the feedback to guide our direction. So, as I've had a couple of weeks worth of thinking time, here are some ideas that I've had for each category so far. Number one, active dry boxes. A couple of years ago, I tried to make the simplest filament dry box I could with a Tupperware style box and some 3D printed parts. It works very well, but there have been some issues that I've learned from. Firstly, the specific system of box that I used isn't available everywhere in the world when YouTube and my channel are. I had a lot of comments from people asking for an alternative box that they could find locally. What I think we need is a way for anyone to use any kind of box that can be found where each person lives. The most common lowcost boxes are things like cereal containers, but there will be many other options that fit a filament spool. What possibly made my solution even more difficult is that I use desicant packs containing calcium chloride. These are great for keeping a very low humidity inside the box, but it means the box has to be bigger as a result. So, I want many different box styles and shapes to be usable so that it becomes a solution that anyone can use. So, what about the active part? Well, what many of you told me was that you wanted to be able to either dry the filament while it was in the dry box or at least be able to recharge the desicant. Some manufacturers have had a go at this solution. Two that spring to mind are Polymakers Poly Dryer and Sunloo's SP2. Both of these separate the filament storage box from the dryer. The idea being that once the filament's dry, you can take the box off, seal it up, and use it for storing the filament. The big problem with both of these options is that if you want more than one box for your filament, it can become very expensive as you have to buy each manufacturer's specific box. Also, what happens if you invest in one of these systems and buy multiple boxes and then a couple of years down the line, your dryer breaks and the manufacturer no longer makes them? You're left with lots of expensive storage boxes. What if we could use a very similar system, but design a universal connection method that would work on any box you can find locally? All we really need is some kind of connector in the box that allows air to pass through and then a filament dryer that has corresponding connectors. I couldn't help seeing if this idea has any legs, so I've already knocked up a very basic dry brake style connector that's cheap and easy to 3D print, which I'll be fitting to one of my dry boxes and a filament dryer so that I can experiment. Watch this space as I think we could make something that works quite quickly with this one. So, option two, the large cabinet idea. What I think we would need to be very careful to avoid is having to all use the same cabinet. Much like the dry box issue, you need to be able to use whatever you can find near to you to keep the cost down. The big problem I can see with this one is not only drawing a large volume of air inside the cabinet, but doing it quickly so that when you open the door, any moist air that enters is dried or removed quick enough to stop it being absorbed into any of your filament. Some of you use dehumidifiers inside the cabinet. Others have other solutions. I haven't given this one as much thought as some of the others, but I wonder if we could have some kind of system that uses some kind of large desicant hopper outside of the cabinet that the air can be circulated through quickly when the doors closed and then the desicant dried either automatically or manually when it gets too damp. The big downside to this one in my eyes is that it doesn't have any method for actually drying the filament specifically, only maintaining it. Need some thought. Option three for the fully automated vending machine is going to be a big project. This one's going to need a large cabinet style container, some kind of carousel style rack that rotates, mechanisms for picking and delivering the filament, and probably some kind of air lock for the spools being picked so that we don't run into the large cabinet problem of letting in damp air. I really like the challenge with this one, but it's going to take a lot more thought, and I'm not sure how many other people will actually build one themselves. I feel like we do have to do it though, just to see if we can actually solve all of the filament storage issues in a money no object project. And then finally, inline drying is technically possible, especially for the more hyroscopic filaments. Anything that absorbs moisture quickly will also give up the moisture quite quickly, too. So, it could be a good solution for materials like PA or nylon. We'd also need to find a way of doing it that costs a lot less than the commercial options, though. The basics of filament drying are that you need to excite the moisture inside the filament with heat to get it moving around and then you need to have dry air next to it to take any moisture particles away. Different filament can handle different temperatures and something like PLA can only tolerate being heated to around 55° which means that the moisture moves around less and it takes longer to draw it out of the filament. Filament like nylon can get a lot hotter, so it doesn't need to be processed for as long to remove the moisture. This makes inline drawing more practical, but there are some challenges to overcome. So, tell me your thoughts. I want ideas for each category. I want additional categories if we've missed anything. And if nothing else, a comment with a number telling me which option you're most excited about. Your feedback is what will guide this whole project. And without it, it's just me sitting in a room coming up with ideas. From here on, I imagine that I'll start making videos showing the progress of each physical storage solution. I'm fully aware that I've completely ignored the need for keeping track of each spool of filament and any kind of database. This is partly because I haven't given it too much thought and partly because it's clear that we needed to work on the physical solutions first. I will very much be looking at how we keep track of everything with each of these four options as we develop them. And I really want to know how you think we should tackle the issue with each physical solution, too. So, hit subscribe if you want to see what comes next. Thanks for watching and commenting, and I'll see you in the next one.",success,1,2026-01-30T17:58:24.274096+00:00
