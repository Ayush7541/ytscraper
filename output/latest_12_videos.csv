paltsNeM6Y0,New 3D Printer? Watch This First,"https://brilliant.org/rickyimpey
Try Brilliant free for 30 days + get 20% off an annual subscription.

If you’ve just bought your first 3D printer — or you’re about to open the box — this is the video you should watch first.

This beginner-friendly guide walks you through the most important things you need to know before you even turn your 3D printer on. It’s designed to help first-time users avoid the most common (and frustrating) mistakes that can ruin your first print or even damage your printer.

I’m not going to tell you to buy loads of extra tools or read hundreds of pages of instructions. Instead, I’ll show you the simple, practical steps that actually matter, using the experience I’ve gained from setting up and using countless 3D printers over the years.

I’ve decided to finally do something about it.
This video kicks off a new open-source project to design the ultimate filament storage and access system — one that actually solves moisture, organization, and usability problems once and for all.

I don’t have all the answers, and that’s the point. I want your ideas, feedback, and experience to help shape the future of filament storage.

Pt2j2BWcAqM,Flexing on TPU: The Best Flexible Filament Alternatives for 3D Printing,"TPU has been the go-to flexible filament for years, but is it still the best choice? In this video, I put TPU head-to-head against newer alternatives like PEBA, Morphlex, and PLA-HR to see which flexible filament really performs.

You’ll see side-by-side comparisons, bounce tests, and real-world prints to find out where TPU still shines — and where the other materials completely out-flex it.

Whether you’re printing phone cases, gaskets, flexible hinges, or even sports gear, this guide will help you choose the right flexible filament for your 3D printing projects.

Casciq9ehTk,3D Printing for Beginners: From Model to Print with Orca Slicer,"Just got a 3D printer and have no idea what to do next—or what half the technical jargon even means? I get it—I’ve been there. That’s why this video breaks everything down, step-by-step. No confusing terms, no techy overwhelm and no fluff,—just exactly what you need to go from downloading your first 3D model through to slicing it like a pro and getting it running on your printer. If you're brand new, this is the perfect place to start. Let’s get into it!

*3d Printing Glossary*

*3D Model*
A digital file that represents the shape of an object. Common formats include .STL, .3MF, or .OBJ.

*G-code*
The set of instructions your printer follows to build a model—telling it where to move, how fast, what temperature to use, and how much filament to extrude.

*Slicer Software*
A program that converts your 3D model into G-code. It slices the model into thin layers and calculates the exact printer movements. Examples: Orca Slicer, Bambu Studio, Cura.

*Print Profile*
A saved group of slicer settings for a specific printer, material, or quality level.

*Layer Height*
The thickness of each printed layer. Smaller layers mean more detail but longer print times.

*Infill*
The internal structure of a 3D print. You can control the density and pattern. More infill makes a part stronger.

*Supports*
Temporary structures that help hold up parts of your model that overhang or would otherwise print in mid-air.

*Overhang*
Any part of a model that extends outward beyond the layers below it. Steep overhangs often need supports.

*Bridge*
A horizontal section of filament printed across a gap. Many printers can handle short bridges without needing support.

*Z Seam*
The vertical line where each new layer starts. Its position affects the look of your final print.

*Skirt*
A line printed around your model to help prime the nozzle before the print begins.

*Brim*
A flat ring printed at the base of your model to help it stick better to the bed and avoid warping.

*Extrude / Extruder*
To push filament through the printer's hot nozzle. The extruder is the part that feeds the filament.

*Calibration Print*
A test print used to fine-tune printer settings like temperature, retraction, and flow.

*PLA / PETG*
Types of 3D printing filament.
PLA: Easy to use and great for beginners.
PETG: Stronger and more flexible, but slightly trickier to print.

*Print Bed*
The flat surface on which your printer builds your model. Often heated to improve adhesion.

*Print Plate (Orca Slicer)*
A virtual workspace in the slicer where you arrange your models before slicing. You can use multiple plates for larger or multi-part projects.

*Retraction*
Pulling filament back slightly between movements to prevent stringing or blobs.

*Firmware*
The internal software that controls how your printer operates and responds to commands.

*IP Address*
A network address that allows slicer software to connect to and control your printer over Wi-Fi.

That’s not the Bambu Lab way though and instead of giving us the 3d printer that we were asking for, they surprised everyone by releasing the H2D, a dual-nozzle, heated-chamber powerhouse that makes the idea of just a 'bigger X1C' look quaint.
Finally, 3d Printing can be what I always wanted it to be!
