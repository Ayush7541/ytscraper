TO_COKkK6Pw,Is Your Faith SABOTAGING Your IMPACT? | Middle Ground Christian,"The problem with lukewarm Christianity is that you blend in with everyone and you impact no one."" Are you following Jesus just enough to be called a disciple, but still betraying Him with your lifestyle? As we move into 2026, it’s time to stop repping the ""Christian jersey"" on the sidelines and actually get on the field. Remember: You may be the only Bible someone ever reads.

In this powerful message, we dive deep into the spiritual danger of the ""middle ground."" Using the warning to the church of Laodicea in Revelation 3, we explore how becoming ""comfortable"" makes us ineffective for the Kingdom of God.

Just like the lukewarm water in the ancient aqueducts of Laodicea, a faith without heat is worthless to a world in need of a savior. We break down the betrayal of Judas, the choice of Joshua (Joshua 24:15), and the sobering reality of Titus 1:16—where people claim to know God but deny Him by the way they live.

If you feel like your impact has been sabotaged by compromise, this video is your wake-up call to stop looking back like Lot's wife and start pursuing your purpose with undivided attention. Don't waste 2026 like you did 2025. It’s time to choose: Christ or Culture?

hb9G_3dqr9I,Men Don't LEAVE 2025 WITHOUT HEARING This,"This Video delves into the core issues holding many men back: a flawed identity rooted in fear, insecurity, confusion, and hesitation. These symptoms arise when one's identity is not anchored in Jesus Christ. The Bible teaches that God has given us a spirit of power, love, and a sound mind, not of fear. When a man is unsure of his identity in God, he hesitates and operates in delayed obedience, waiting for confidence. This hinders his potential and purpose. The key to overcoming these internal battles is not trying harder but standing firm in one's identity in God. When this identity is rebuilt, it transforms the mind, leading to shifts in confidence, clarity, and courage. Every man is created on purpose, for a purpose, and action must stem from a strong sense of identity in Christ.

6NPZ9oRrofc,Breaking the Internal Battles Holding You Back as a Man,"Overcoming Internal Battles: Rebuilding Identity through Scripture

In this episode of Basic Bible, we explore how most men are held back not by external factors but by internal battles such as fear, insecurity, and confusion about their identity and purpose. The video delves into Biblical guidance to help men overcome these struggles by rebuilding their identity and reshaping their thinking. Key scriptures from 2 Timothy 1:7 and Ephesians 2:10 are discussed to highlight that fear, insecurity, and confusion are not from God. Practical steps are provided to identify and replace lies with Biblical truths, act from identity rather than emotions, and understand that transformation is a continuous process. The video encourages men to immerse themselves in the Word of God, surround themselves with like-minded individuals, and consistently act from the identity that God has given them. Viewers are invited to engage by commenting with the word 'identity' and subscribing for more content focused on building men with purpose and impact.

GmcHfaQ_C7s,If you want to hear God clearly watch this,"Hearing God's Voice: Silencing the Noise for Clarity

In this episode, we delve into the struggles many face in hearing God's voice clearly. Contrary to popular belief, it's not about God not speaking, but rather about the challenge of silencing other distracting voices such as fear, doubt, and overthinking. The scripture reveals that God's voice leads us into stillness and clarity, contrasting the noise from the world. Jesus described that believers can hear His voice naturally, underscoring that confusion is not the norm. It's emphasized that a clear mind, aligned with God's word, is necessary to recognize His guidance. Transforming our minds through scripture and prayer is crucial for hearing God's direction. The importance of obeying what God has already spoken is highlighted as a step towards clarity. Viewers are encouraged to silence the worldly noise and realign themselves with God's word for a clearer connection. This episode serves as an invitation to return to scripture, prayer, and obedience for divine clarity.

WEm0xvO7HDk,Your Phone Is Destroying Your Focus (And You Don't Even Know It),"The digital age is influencing our lives more than we realize. How often is the device in your hand (smartphone) dictating your thoughts and values? Jesus warns us in Matthew 6:22-23 that ""The eye is the lamp of the body."" Our eyes and ears are the literal doorways to our soul (mind, heart, and emotions), and they ultimately determine the course of our life (Proverbs 4:23).

In this powerful Christian message, we uncover the spiritual danger of distraction. Christ demands your singularity, your focus, and your undivided attention. He doesn't want to compete with Spotify artists, Instagram influencers, or Netflix. You are constantly being discipled—will you allow Christ or Culture to shape your worldview?

We explore the profound Jewish teaching, ""May you be covered in the dust of your rabbi,"" to understand what it means to be a truly committed disciple of Jesus. This requires us to let the Bible be our filter and the only lens by which we see the world, rather than adopting worldly ideologies. Discover the specific unholy influences (social media, music, movies) Jesus wants you to let go of to clean your soul, become His uncompromised witness, and fully step into your true purpose and calling as a man or woman of God. Learn how guarding your heart brings clarity to God's vision for your future.

00:53 The Spiritual Impact of What We Consume

UU7TLaOj8qY,Is Trump going to heaven? #jesuslovesyou #jesuschrist #shorts,"Here's what the Bible says, it will SHOCK YOU!

1 Peter 2:13-17
13 Submit yourselves for the Lord’s sake to every human authority: whether to the emperor, as the supreme authority, 14 or to governors, who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to commend those who do right. 15 For it is God’s will that by doing good you should silence the ignorant talk of foolish people. 16 Live as free people, but do not use your freedom as a cover-up for evil; live as God’s slaves. 17 Show proper respect to everyone, love the family of believers, fear God, honor the emperor.

1 Timothy 2:1-4
I urge, then, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for all people— 2 for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness. 3 This is good, and pleases God our Savior, 4 who wants all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth.

Romans 13:1-7
Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God. 2 Consequently, whoever rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves. 3 For rulers hold no terror for those who do right, but for those who do wrong. Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority? Then do what is right and you will be commended. 4 For the one in authority is God’s servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for rulers do not bear the sword for no reason. They are God’s servants, agents of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer. 5 Therefore, it is necessary to submit to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also as a matter of conscience.

6 This is also why you pay taxes, for the authorities are God’s servants, who give their full time to governing. 7 Give to everyone what you owe them: If you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then respect; if honor, then honor.

Also, I mixed up Peter with Paul. I meant to say Paul.
