What Is Slicer Ninja?

Slicer Ninja is a web-based tool designed to take the guesswork out of slicer settings.

Instead of digging through menus, forums, and trial-and-error prints, Slicer Ninja analyzes your model, your printer, and your filament, then recommends optimized slicer settings automatically. The goal is simple: better prints, less waste, and less time spent fighting your slicer.

You upload a model, select your printer and material, and Slicer Ninja helps optimize things like orientation, layer height, walls, infill, flow, and speed—based on real-world printing logic, not generic presets. It’s built to work with your existing slicer, not replace it.

Whether you’re new to 3D printing or you’ve been doing this for years, Slicer Ninja is meant to save time, reduce failed prints, and help you get consistent results without overthinking every setting.",1113,28,5,0.02965
YiMevD99WKE,The Truth: Bambu Lab Finally Clears The Air,"🎉 PROMO ALERT
Use PROMO CODE: STAY20 and get 20% OFF our all-new MorphX TPU filament.
⏰ Offer ends 2-10-26 — limited supply available, so don’t wait.

In this video, I directly question Bambu Lab about recent changes to their Terms & Conditions and Terms of Use, and what those updates really mean for everyday users. Link to Bambu lab ToS Document's.....https://bambulab.com/en-us/policies/terms

Specifically, we break down:
How the new software and firmware terms affect Bambu Lab 3D printers
Whether enabling Developer Mode can impact warranty coverage
If refusing firmware updates could void your warranty
Concerns around data collection and user privacy
Claims of hidden changes and whether anything was intentionally buried
Allegations of unethical business practices — fact vs rumor

The goal of this video is to clear the air, separate truth from speculation, and provide on-the-record answers so the community can make informed decisions instead of reacting to misinformation.
If you’ve been confused by the recent controversy, worried about losing warranty protection, or unsure how these updates affect the way you use your printer — this video is for you.

If this video helped you, consider liking, subscribing, and sharing it with other makers who may still be confused by the situation. My goal is transparency — not hype.",19689,608,317,0.046981
OReSdBUIe3A,Is 3D Printing About To Take a Dive?,"Lawmakers are trying to invade makers privacy and dictate what we can and cannot 3-D print on a machine that we bought and paid for in a home that we own as a free American. 
Make it illegal, but you don’t get to install software that spies on me. 
What’s next? Will they install cameras in our house to make sure we’re not committing a crime?",1293,46,21,0.051817

vsVbjtoe-g8,Prusa Keeps The Pressure On Competitors with THIS!,"The 3D printing market is moving fast right now — and instead of slowing down, Prusa Research is doubling down on meaningful innovation.

In this video, I break down Prusa’s latest move, including a major new add-on release that pushes the Prusa CORE One platform forward and keeps it competitive as other brands roll out similar ideas. Rather than chasing trends, Prusa continues to refine what actually matters: reliability, expandability, and long-term usability.

I also share my honest thoughts on the CORE One — where it shines, where it could improve, and how it stacks up in an increasingly crowded field. This isn’t hype or brand loyalty — it’s a real discussion about innovation, pacing, and what keeps a company relevant as the industry accelerates.
